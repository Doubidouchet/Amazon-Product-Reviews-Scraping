While this ended up not being the model that fit my lifestyle, they took my product feedback and replied diligently across days. It screen is better than the cheap 768p panels on MOST budget devices. And it isn't limited to ChromeOS despite being half the price of many most prominent branded Chromebooks.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is a heck of a deal for what you get.  8G RAM, a decent sized SSD, IPS FHD screen.  The Celeron N4000 is a bit pokey but if you keep your overhead down, it's very useable and the fanless aspect of it is really nice.  I hope they make a few more models of these.","positive":1},{"review":"  Let me start by saying that I did have a technical problem with the computer. The charge cable became loose and wouldn't charge the computer reliably. On the other hand, I can't guarantee that about ANY company - my computer before last was an Asus and had the exact same problem as this one. But if or WHEN something does go wrong, they're willing and able to help, and just because of that, I'd be happy to buy from Chuwi again the next time I need a computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer has served it's purpose well to date. If you are in need of a lightweight computer with good battery life and decent memory (for the price you can't complain), then this is the laptop for you. but does not disappoint me.

These two are completely different in terms of processing power and capabilities, but I paid close to $1100 for the HP, and $279 for the HeroBook.  For the money, its a good laptop and an additional 256G of memory makes this a light-weight full Windows-supported travel companion with WiFi and bluetooth support.  Ive seen the price go up a few times, so get it while its under $300.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got two of these for my kids so they could do their homework during this whole \"distance learning\" mess.

She is seven and I didn't want to spend a lot if she broke it but something good enough for online schooling.

Oh the touch pad can be annoying sometimes I recommend a mouse if you get tired of it, so far I haven't been annoyed enough to buy one.","positive":1},{"review":"  Let me explain what the use case was hete: my partner uses a laptop for writing, grading, internet research, listening to music and the occasional movie, fairly light applications. However, they use it 6-8 hours a day, public transit commute with it, travel with it, and use it at home, so heavy use in that sense. If you don't mind it being slow and don't need it do much heavy lifting it could work for you.  But that is my review based on this use case, I hope it's helpful.","positive":0},{"review":"  This has to be the worst laptop I have ever had.  They take the slowest processor one can purchase, and an ssd, along with the slowest network adapter made since AOL used a phone line.

All the while my daughter will not be able to use it to do her school work.I hope to update this with a good resolution but to have something fail so quickly out of the gate and have to send it back in and wait is frustrating when kids are depending on these to do their remote learning.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my daughter so she could try out some drawing apps, but unfortunately I did not do my research.  We tried 8 different stylus pens and they either did not work at all or managed to get a few squiggles.  If you have any plans to draw go with something else, probably and ipad.  If you just need a computer, it works great.","positive":0},{"review":"  Was looking for a Chromebook for kid #2 and wanted something that would match the awesome Asus Flip C302 that kid #1 has been using for the last 2 years.  The newer Asus models are too expensive.  Lenovo needs to update their website (still says \"coming soon\" as of 8-17-2020) and ship this model to their authorized resellers asap.  There are more powerful models, but this is THE ONE that hits the sweet spot.","positive":1},{"review":"  So, this is my first ever chromebook.  My old Macbook Pro was dying and when thinking about what I needed, I realized I would be fine with a more simple system.Overall, I really like this device.  Its simple, no frills (which i liked) and I am ok with a mid-tier device.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m a senior and have had and used many laptops over the years. A year or two ago I thought the simplicity of a Chromebook sounded interesting. It does seem under spec`d, but decided if I were to use zoom more than I have I might look at a plug in camera. That`s always an option and not a deal breaker for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a great laptop, I bought it for working remotely and school. The camera quality isn't the best, it's what you expect from a laptop. I didn't realize until I got it.In summary, it works to fit my needs but I wanted to let you know the bad and the ugly before you buy this.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, this is arguably one of the best chromebooks you can get right now for the money - if it wasn't for my unit's light-bleeding and display clouding. It's a very capable and versatile chromebook. Coming from a Pixelbook, which has a smaller, but much brighter and clearer display, it was the main issue that I couldn't overlook, even after trying to ignore for a few days. I've returned it, and may in the future order a new one to find out if Lenovo tightens up its quality control.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been a 'chromebooker' since 2012 and this is my fourth one. The fit and finish are excellent. I was concerned that the 4 GB of ram would be too little, but it hasn't presented any problems. The camera is standard 720 and mediocre, but works fine and has the advantage of erasing some of the lines of age in the face because it is not as sharp as it could be.","positive":1},{"review":"  Decided to replace my laptop with a Chromebook and was the best decision. You can't get anything better for this price, great value. The Google ecosystem also makes it real easy to set up a kids account for safety.One thing I would note is that the webcam is average and wouldn't be a good fit for professional web meetings but once again, this is a $400 machine we are talking about.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this Lenevo Chromebook for my 77 year-old wife to replace her 5 year old MacBook Air. Great purchase. I`ll keep it until it no longer works for my purposes which in addition to my wife`s includes movies and streaming. When that day comes I definitely will switch to a chrome book.","positive":1},{"review":"  This ChromeBook is very easy to use.  It sets up very fast, and if you have a Google account, all your apps will be there as soon as you log in.  But you must be able to live in the Google universe.  But I do, so I'm quite happy with this device.","positive":1},{"review":"  It was time to upgrade my Lenovo 500e Chromebook to something with a larger screen and thinner bezels. The up-firing speakers are nice and the backlit keyboard is another bonus. This feels like a premium Chromebook for a mid-range price. So far very happy with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am disappointed with this purchase.  The computer was defective and stopped working after only two months.  If Lenovo or Amazon think this is how to provide customer satisfaction they are wrong.  I wont buy another Lenovo product and the next computer I buy wont be from Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  its a fairly nice computer but the speaker is broken.The audio clips at the high points of the audio so bad it makes my ears ring.It came like this and i am incredibly disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Although i have minimum hours on this chrome book, I've had multiple instances of the trackpad not working. It appears to freeze, not allowing me to use the pad as a mouse and forcing me to use the touch screen.  This is very frustrating and seems to occur often for others, but others cant have it occur as often as I do.  Help, this is driving me nuts.","positive":0},{"review":"  I paid more than I normally would for a chromebook for my son at school and I`m sorry I did. He dropped this on carpeting in his classroom and the screen shattered and hinge broke. Way too much damage for such a minor incident.","positive":0},{"review":"  Chromebook works alright as a web browser, but not much else. None of the android apps work correctly. Some apps that work perfectly on our phone and on the iPad, like Zoom or Messenger Kids, just randomly freeze and lock up the whole system. We bought this for our daughter to use for classes and chatting with her friends, and we are very disappointed with it as the two main apps are just awful.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this for my son with special needs because of the touch screen to make using the computer easier. After 2 weeks the touch screen does not work and I can't get anyone to help resolve the issue. Don't buy from this company.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unfortunately, I had to return this item. After less than a week of use I noticed that the touch screen was glitchy. Aside from that problem I actually did quite like the device. Wish it had worked properly.","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved this device. The great value faded when, in just over three months after purchase, the system no longer charges. Cheap. Yes.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is not what i expected. I wish i would not have decided on chromebook or at least this one.  Several things I dont like but the biggest I read it was light weight but sturdy its not light weight at all. Picture quality is not good.","positive":0},{"review":"  I would not have ought this had they mentioned it was not combatible with a printer, then I paid almost 28 bucks to ship it back and got only a 400 refund 100 dollars short of what amazon is charging to my account very expensive lesson I learned.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is my second chromebook. I bought this one because it had better specs as far as the Intel I3 goes for the price range. very fast and affordable for the specs. remember chromebooks do not need all the processor power a PC needs so an i3 in this thing is very powerful.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am really enjoying this Lenovo Chromebook Flex 13 inch. It has the backlit keyboard, all new 10th generation processor which makes it nice and fast. Really enjoying this chromebook and it was money well spent. Lenovo did a good job with this one.","positive":1},{"review":"  We purchased this Chromebook for our rising kindergartner who is starting this year in full virtual learning.  The battery holds through the entire school day and still has 20-30% power left at the end of the day when we open it to check for assignments.  And the chassis is solid and doesn't flex or bend when he's opening it or adjusting the screen tilt.All-in-all, this is a well-made product and is working well so far (a month into use).","positive":1},{"review":"  First time chromebook user and I love it. The interface and chrome os is super easy to use. I was originally going to wait for the i5 model but who knows when or if it will in the US. (I stopped following the press release and news for it after receiving this).","positive":1},{"review":"  We were looking for an upgraded Chromebook and the specs for this model were good. We are not really power users who have 15 windows open at all times, just need the basics. It took some time to figure out that there is a small sliding lens cover built into the top of the screen. If you accidentally slide this and the camera stops working it will take some time to figure it out.","positive":1},{"review":"  just got this for my mom moving her from Windows.  love this device for the price its really nice...","positive":1},{"review":"  I think it's incredible for the price. Keyboard is great, trackpad works fine, screen is difficult to clean, I have no problem with 4GB of RAM and the \"screen bleed\" some reviewers whine about doesn't seem to be a problem for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I gave this as a gift to my significant other.  Overall he loves it, the screen display is beautiful and the backlighting for the keyboard makes it look really cool.  He has ordered two and had to send them back because even though they say they are compatible, they have not been.  Perhaps because the laptop is so new.","positive":1},{"review":"  I want a decent Chromebook tablet.  I tried the duet but it's slow and lags.  the i3 processor here works much better but it's too cumbersome, thick, and heavy to bend the keyboard around and use this as a tablet.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's fast, really fast. A Chromebook that has an Intel Core i3 will fly and this certainly does. Check out YouTube video reviews to get a better look at it. I bought it in June and I'm still crazy about it.","positive":1},{"review":"  A keycap came damaged and won't stay on. I've been unable to find replacement caps for this model either from Lenovo or from 3rd party suppliers.Unfortunately the original packaging was thrown away before I noticed the defect. I hope I'm not stuck with this damaged laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  specs looked great on paper screen, but..  speakers volume also sucks when in tablet yoga mode. Not recommended.","positive":0},{"review":"  Keeps freezing  locking up. camera is terrible.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was bought for my son for virtual school. It is falling apart the screen of literally popping off of the computer. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. The Lenovo service is also terrible.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product has been a nightmare for my son to use for distance learning. The camera doesn`t work with Zoom. Do not buy this. Get a regular laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Sound quality is bad and the volume does not get high enough.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s too slow. Not sure if it is because mine has  defect.","positive":0},{"review":"  Parece un m\u00f3vil en forma de ordenador, no te deja descargar o abrir la mayor\u00eda de documentos que mi universidad me manda,complica mucho acciones que se pueden hacer por atajos de teclado en aplicaciones y no puedes capturar parte de la pantalla sin tener un l\u00e1piz t\u00e1ctil.Useless.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very slow and buggy computer, I had an acer chromebook that was starting to slow down so I bought this and its so slow and buggy that the old computer is still faster.","positive":0},{"review":"  This chromebook works well, but two weeks into online teaching the camera died and I am unable to use the camera feature in google meets with students. I have been in touched with Lenovo about getting the camera repaired.","positive":0},{"review":"  My Macbook Pro's motherboard crapped out and I picked this up as a last ditch effort. I've been on a MBP for the last decade and after a few weeks of this Chromebook, I don't miss it. why pay for the excess. Maybe you'll have a similar experience.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Chromebook works smoothly for my needs as a SPED TA. I can be on multiple Google Meets at the same time and have several other tabs open simultaneously. It gets me through the entire school day easily on one charge with more to spare. I would definitely recommend it for this purpose.","positive":1},{"review":"  For what it is intended for a great value. Easy to set up and use,very light, long lasting battery-12 hours I got out of it.The keyboard is a bit small and will take some getting used to.I love this product and now I am worried that I won't use my other devices.","positive":1},{"review":"  Speedy laptop and very responsive. The keyboard has nice travel and the touchpad feels good even if it's plastic. The screen looks amazing but in dark environments, too much brightness reveals a lot a bleeding around the edges but not necessarily awful depending on your lighting conditions. This machine, even with it's faults is basically a no brainier to buy for it's price as it provides enough features to the table with few drawbacks.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'll keep it simple...Like - Solid build feel  - Aluminum top shell  - Back-lit keyboard that auto shuts off.","positive":1},{"review":"  Enjoyable easy to use laptop, well made, features are great, Chrome works well and supports all the software we use. The versatility of this pc is great, regular laptop position, fold it over to use it like a tablet, plus even in the touch screen mode if you need a keyboard will popup.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been an excellent laptop for school, now that everything has been moved to live online and online. Camera is passable, but the rest of this device well built. Does not feel cheap and toy-ish like other Chromebooks. Battery life can be destroyed by Zoom, but what laptop battery life isn`t diminished by remote meeting sessions all day.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this for my younger brother who just finished highschool and he loves it. It's a very cool machine. Excluding any CPU intensive gaming, I think this computer can handle almost everything my brother will need from it. For the price quality this is really a great deal.","positive":1},{"review":"  Me gusta mucho, pero se recomienda para personas que solo realizan trabajo de oficina y navegaci\u00f3n web.En formato de tableta debo decir que es bastante pesada e incomoda.El balance costo - producto esta bien.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you like Chromebooks, this is a great 2 in 1 laptop.  Easy to set up and boots up right away.  I wanted a basic laptop and this works great for me. Includes USB ports, micro SD card slot, Bluetooth compatible for headphones, charges fast.","positive":1},{"review":"  Track pad was practically unusable.  Returned it same day received.","positive":0},{"review":"  Where to start.  First, what has changed.I had hoped this would be a useful tool, but find that I would be better off with a tablet with keyboard cover.  I would NOT recommend this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  My kids have had one each since the lockdown started.Pros:It's enough for them to get basic work done.11ax to do that. Lenovo has no Chromebook update available to fix the know firmware issues with the Integrated Intel WiFi chipset they used.","positive":0},{"review":"  We were quite excited about this device (Lenovo Flex 5 13\" chromebook). Everything seemed 'just right' for us. In addition, this machine does not have the International Warranty Service (IWS). Chx_Lenovo\"For us, this is a deal breaker and we will be returning the device.","positive":0},{"review":"  Everything is perfect except for the screen which is the main part that you use on this laptop. It has a great weight, it has a smaller footprint than the 14\" HP Chromebook (which also has the worst brightness), it has more than enough performance for most use in a Chromebook and best of all, the price is really good. Good luck to me finding one and import it. I really like this Chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  Try to use Zoom and keeps freezing up.I can`t figure it out and this computer is useless for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  Immediately when I started to use the laptop one of the plastic pieces that keep the screen on broke off. It just got worse from there within a month as the other plastic piece on the other side of the screen broke off. Waiting for Leveno support to call me back and they are taking there time. If a small plastic piece comes off the laptop hinge put it back and immediately return the laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I needed an inexpensive light laptop for casual use and I am happy with this Lenovo. I like that I can link it with my Android phone and it unlocks the computer. The screen is fine and I have no complaints about the keyboard.","positive":1},{"review":"  We bought this for our daughter for school. It was a great deal. The screen is great resolution and the size is perfect for her needs. I hope this will last her until high school.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for granddaughter for school.  really like the features, sd card, 2 usb charge ports on either side. seems plenty fast on bootup and operation.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great chrome book.. Love speed and back-lit keyboard.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my 2nd Chromebook and honestly, I'm thinking about switching completely.  The Flex 5 is amazing.  No lag that I see.  It's perfect for my kids while they are doing school work.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything you want a Chromebook to do is done perfectly in this Lenovo except for the sound  could be a little louder. Camera is top notch, live video sessions are amazing, the screen flips for touchscreen gaming, the keyboard is backlit for night time working, the speakers are located on top, which is a plus.","positive":1},{"review":"  Really nice laptop. Probably the nicest keyboard I've ever typed on. Probably not a dealbreaker for most, but it's a little annoying. Other than that it's very very nice, especially considering the price point.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this chromebook for two weeks and it's been working like a champ. I bought this as an upgrade for my previous chromebook and it's like night and day. The Flex 5 is faster, the screen is so much clearer, the laptop itself feels so much more solid and well built, and the speakers are a huge improvement. Add the touch screen, tablet mode, and back-lit keyboard and it equals a very good product at a reasonable price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Carry this around and use for everything.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my 3rd Chromebook, and this has exceeded my expectations.  The laptop is well-built, and FAST.  If you use mostly the web day to day, then this will be a perfect daily driver.","positive":1},{"review":"  Compared to the school-issued Chromebooks, this is a completely different level of quality. Faster, better screen, better keyboard. Well worth the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Seems to be a good quality phonebook but I can't give it 5 stars because it won't download some of the software apps I need which is one of the main reasons I bought it, so I may need to buy something else. This may end up going to my son for his schoolwork instead. However, no complaints with the seller or delivery.","positive":1},{"review":"  Was looking for the best i3 chromebook and this did not disappoint.

Smooth to the touch very sturdy and about the best product I ever bought on amazon .","positive":1},{"review":"  For the $410 price especially, it's great.

If you're just looking for a basic Chromebook, this one is a very solid option with only a few drawbacks that don't really knock off any stars.If you're looking for a versatile, well-priced laptop Chromebook, this one is a great option.

I work on a computer daily, and although I don't know a ton about computers I do know when one works well and doesn't work well and this one gets the job done. This chromebook works well, it comes with a good size ram of 8GB and the touchscreen has no issues as well as the two in one option. For a lower end laptop option, this is a great quality computer to get school work done and small tasks.","positive":1},{"review":"  Review of the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 13\":  This compact and sturdy Chromebook is great for any use and application.

It`s exactly what I was looking for, and seems like it`ll serve me for years to come.","positive":1},{"review":"  I initially got this laptop to do minor work (Word, canvas, picmonkey, advertising) but I pushed it a bit further and play League of Legends. It runs. There are moments when the game loads up and the window seems like it closed out, but that's only for 5 seconds and you're in the game.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for my child to use for distance learning kindergarden. I really haven't messed around with it to see how it preforms. EVEN AS ADMIN I CUD NOT CHANGE SYS SETTINGS. With that said computer works great if u get rid of S and switch to windows 10 and it's free to do so dont get scared when it says u will lose S forever and can not  change back, click swich.","positive":1},{"review":"  I received and set up the computer with no problems. After using it for a week or two, I closed it down and used my other computer, a desktop, for two or three weeks. Then press and hold down the on button until the machine boots up again.That's what fixed my problem.","positive":1},{"review":"  The free upgrade to Windows 10 was changed from Pro to Home version, but that may be fine, seems to be. And as another described, is a true \"little work horse\". Increased RAM, faster processor and increased capacities and lower costs of available microSD cards providing plenty of storage, make this very portable laptop able do the same or more work than with any PC I've had in the past. Love it so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  Actually it was slow to startup at first and didnt run for a day or two but ever time after that iy has been running smpothly and effortlessly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I think this computer is fine. It arrived looking new and in perfect condition. Read the reviews, read the Q&As, look at the customer pictures. Don`t rely on the description and product pictures alone.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have only used this product for a little over a month. I don't require a lot from my small computer. GENERAL NOTE: If you don't leave your laptop on when you're not using it, I recommend going to \"settings\" and checking for updates on a regular basis. There were a bunch of updates needed when I first brought it up and that was an on-going need for several days.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'll start with the happy surprises. First, you can easily remove the \"S mode\" aspect and upgrade to full Windows 10 64 bit in seconds. I found this product through the \"Item comparison\" list where it says 1920x1080 and that was a big part of the reason I bought it.As a result of the multiple examples of misleading advertising, I will be giving this one star less than I feel it would deserve otherwise.","positive":0},{"review":"  Really wanted to like this.  I have 2 other Asus products that are true to the Asus tagline \"Incredible\".  This machine cost $50 more and has none of those.  It's basically an overpriced Chromebook without any of the benefits.","positive":0},{"review":"  It doesn't have touch screen for 1. It is small so portability is good, however it still runs in an aspect ratio that makes visuals hard to see, but that's not my main complaint...","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the laptop specifically so I wouldn't have to be stuck at my desk, on my desktop, when I wanted to work on things. Started out just fine, too.I liked the laptop, which was the sad thing. Now it just sits and collects dust since my desktop is superior in every way anyway.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just be careful if you care how it looks, the cover scars easily, I carried this in a nylon stuff sack in a backpack.  The laptop was next to my back and it's top, the glossy top, was next to a camera in a camera bag with 1 2\" of foam between its inner and outer nylon material.  The gloss of the cover was abraded so it has random marks on it, disappointing when I was treating it about as well as practicable.  I guess I could leave it at home in its box.","positive":0},{"review":"  By far the nicest feature of this laptop is it's portability.  It's *extremely* light compared to other similarly-sized laptops I've used.  I have no idea if it's a hardware or software issue.I would say overall it's a decent laptop, but if I were doing it over again, I'd probably look elsewhere primarily due to the annoyance of the touchpad.","positive":0},{"review":"  It will no longer turn on. There is no information on how to get help, if you click the support key you just get a list of features. This laptop was purchased 7 mos ago and it is just dead. Disappointed in the quality and customer support.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had to send it back battery dose not charge.","positive":0},{"review":"  Nice physical design, slim, lightweight, very portable.  Nice display and overall function.5 21 Update:  The laptop performed inadequately in the activity for which I attempted to re-purpose it.  Therefore I returned it and purchased a refurbished Dell laptop with i7 core for just $100 more.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had no idea what to expect with this computer. I was just excited to have a windows computer instead of a Chromebook but I was wrong. That S mode thing is really dumb. I don't recommend this laptop to anyone.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm a first year college student, and this laptop is fantastic for mobile meetings getting work done, or gaming. I play Minecraft on it a lot, and it never tears. The battery seems to go in a few hours or so, but that's to be expected. Better than the $500 laptop I returned earlier this year.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very happy with this machine.  It does exactly what I want it to do, which is be small and light, run Firefox and MS Office, and connect to my printer, all tasks where the Chromebook it replaces fails.  It handles YouTube, Netflix and the like very well.  For a basic, on-the-go machine, this one fits the bill perfectly.","positive":1},{"review":"  Its very ok for high school students. It's not got a lot of storage but it's a great bargain for the price. So it's worth purchasing. Yeah, I would buy again if I needed it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a descent low end laptop.  Of course it is not a powerhouse gaming or video editing platform.04 LTS and everything worked with zero manual configuration.  The system was paired with an external dongle for a RJ45 connection and added port capacity.","positive":1},{"review":"  Started school and have a couple of online classes so I bought this so I can work on homework reading at work during my lunch and so I can take it on the go if I leave town. It's a very convenient size and I'm really liking the keyboard.  I don't mind the Windows 10 S at all since I'm not really interested in downloading a bunch of apps. Usually use google chrome, but Microsoft Edge isn't bad at all.","positive":1},{"review":"  This ASUS vivobook is small, light, and efficient, great for computer use on the move, especially when weight is an issue.  It isn't the equivalent of a desktop or a larger, more powerful laptop, but it may do until you can get to one.  This reviewer is not a gamer, but the graphics seem decent.  Recommended for limited purpose.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had bought a laptop with a defective hinge last year. Which unexpectedly broke on me. Can be carried with one hand easily without weighing your arm down. And battery life is the best I've ever had with a laptop, honestly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I paid $190.19 for this, which is almost cheaper than the software itself. Keyboard is solid, size is smaller than a standard textbook, case is seemingly durable. Programs such as Word start up quickly, edge browser is very quick on a high speed connection.","positive":1},{"review":"  I went through 3 different lower end laptops (I only need it to run a couple windows specific programs that don't work on MAC) and THIS one is quite the little powerhouse.  Very well built, sturdy, and FAST.I never thought I'd hear myself say this as a staunch mac user but this little buddy has made me a PC Windows fan again. That right there is quite a feat.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a writer and can't be without a computer. When my laptop decided to die on me, I transferred my external hard drive to this little guy and it worked perfectly. This computer doesn't have a whole lot of memory, so unless you're going to store your large files on an external drive, this isn't that great. For just getting online and doing regular things you're not storing on it, good to go.","positive":1},{"review":"  You get what you pay for... but this laptop cannot do them either.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very unhappy with this product. Bought when they had the black Friday deals, went through the set up of everything. I wanted to return for a replacement, but I'm scared of this happening again and then being out the refund time. Very upset with this product and I honestly would not recommend purchasing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Too small. Limited storage.  Trying now to wipe it completely to give to my niece, for very basic stuff. One pro: highly portable and lightweight.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had unit for just 6 months.  Stopped working.  However, I do not know how long I will be without the unit.  Bad news.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not realize this but this laptop came with Windows Home 10 S which doesn't allow you to download and install any un-approved software not in the Microsoft Store. Google Chrome is not approved.  So it took me hours of frustration just to install my Google Chrome.","positive":0},{"review":"  NOT a Touch Screen as the initial search had indicated. This was one of the main reasons I purchased the item.What a waste of stress, money and time. Returning.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really disappointed in this purchase.  When I took it out of the box and fired it up, I discovered that HALF of the memory was being used by Windows 10.  Wow, I miss the good old days when you could trust that you would get what you ordered without a bunch of strings attached.  Major disappointment.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just returned home from vacation, opened my package, and my entire screen has a HUGE crack black line going across it....","positive":0},{"review":"  The battery life made this a non-starter. However the most frustrating issue was intermittent dropping of WiFi.)  broken hinge. Returned this self contained PC TECHNICAL SCHOOL device and BOUGHT ANOTHER Stream.","positive":0},{"review":"  Do not buy. I Bought it 3 months ago and it's not working anymore.  Now I have a piece of junk and ASUS doesn't help.

I bought it for my teacher wife who carries it back and forth to school. You also need to be able to live with the not upgradable aspect.  We`re glad we bought it and just hope that it last a long time like my last ASUS laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for a small-yet-sturdy laptop that could be tossed in my bag and easily transported to and from work, the library, a coffee shop, or just within my house. I mostly use it for the Microsoft Office suite and web browsing, occasionally some light video streaming, and that's about it. Honestly, unless you need a full on gaming laptop or something for intense video editing, this is probably all you'll need. Couldn't ask for better, especially for such a great price.","positive":1},{"review":"  i needed a computer for basic work. MS office, internet, and the like. the battery lasts forever. i'm very happy and would highly recommend this.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered one of these for my youngest son to do his schoolwork after the schools were all closed, so he wouldn't have to keep using my work laptop. It works really well. Overall, for this price, this is a really great laptop. I would recommend these to anyone that needs a laptop, maybe not for anything heavy duty, but for personal use it's great.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little compact laptop for the price.  I opted to get the 64GB RAM version with Office 365 instead of the one offered with more storage (128GB).  Overall, it performs well and I am happy I went with this brand.  I've had it about two months now and I've been pleased with it's performance.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is perfect for a traveling writer.  It has enough horsepower and memory to do some lightweight games, like older isometric games, or board games for when the work is done.  The one and only complaint is no lit keyboard, but that is easily solved with a small USB powered lamp for $9, like this one I ordered.\"USB Reading Lamp, PIKADO Premium 14 LED, 3 Brightness Setting Touch-Switch Laptop Light with Flexible Gooseneck (Black)\"For what this laptop is designed to do, you will love it, with ASUS quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop was smaller than I expected. But that's my own fault for not being great at measurements. I was planning on returning it because it wasn't what I had originally wanted but I've fallen in love with how easy it is to carry and move around since it's so compact. This might be the laptop I take with me on trips when I don't want to lug around my huge laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Replaced an older Chromebook with this laptop.  I am very happy with everything about this computer so far.  So, for right now I am so thrilled to have a laptop again.  I use Chrome as my browser and that was easy to load and works quite well.","positive":1},{"review":"  If yours ever stopped working or doesn't turn on though the charging light is still on, unplug everything including power charger, USB, etc. Then press power button for 10 sec. Thanks to Amazon tech support. I didn't know it is a common issue on pc.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros.. I guess they only want me to purchase games from the Microsoft store.Yes, I am miffed.","positive":0},{"review":"  My main reason for the 3 star rating is because it is a decent little basic laptop for internet, email, etc, just DO NOT believe in what the Product information page says:Screen Resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels - WRONGGraphics Coprocessor Intel UHD Graphics 600 - WRONGComputer Memory Type DDR4 SDRAM - WRONGIntel Celeron N4000 Processor (4M Cache, up to 2.6 GHz) - WRONGActually I am somewhat surprised that Amazon allowed this kind of misrepresentation from Asus.The only reason I kept it was because I only wanted it for basic basic procession but still it does NOT feel good to me lied to on the specifications.","positive":0},{"review":"  No me gust\u00f3 es un minicomputador,me sent\u00ed enga\u00f1ada. Demasiado peque\u00f1o.","positive":0},{"review":"  This device lasted only two months before it died. two months.. definitely never an Asus .","positive":0},{"review":"  Completely disappointed.  Laptop was everything I wanted but quit working after less than 25 days.  It`s completely dead and I only used it a handful of times to open excel spreadsheets.  Returning for a refund as I`ve seen too many other reviews with the same issue and I`m afraid the next one will die after the money back time has expired or after the warranty is out.","positive":0},{"review":"  No where in the discription, posting does it indicate used product. Laptop arrived re-packaged and with someone elses account already on the device. If I purchase an item that does not say referbished, restored, previously used, etc, I expect it to be new. I do not appreciate consumer deception by sellers.","positive":0},{"review":"  This company and the seller are nothing but a bunch of RIP OFF and I want my money back.  How can you sell something that half of  the essential keys dont even work. BUYERS BEWARE. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS: I AM RETURNING  IT ASAP AND I  WANT MY MONEY BACK ASAP.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this as a typewriter - literally just a simple machine for typing. Unlike a lot of other Windows laptops, I was able to install Linux with ease and it even goes to sleep when I close the lid (no joke that's a huge deal with Linux). The keyboard is absolute garbage. You couldn't pay me to write a page of text on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  My wife liked this product for it portability. Seemed to do the job for basic use...","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this back in January 2020. Everything was running smoothly up until now which is roughly 7 months to the day I bought this thing. Asus is a company that I will no longer conduct business with and will now but a laptop from a more reputable company like apple. I hate to bash a company like this but it's the truth and just thought that all of you reading this should be aware of this.","positive":0},{"review":"  My friends have a Tuesday game day and they use the desktop simulator from steam, I only have Chromebooks and so I bought this one really for the sole purpose of joining them for game night. Then I realized that you could download and play Warcraft.  now to be clear, all the settings are on the very lowest, this isn't very important to me but I get fast enough FPS and manageable FPS in the cities on the weekends.  Definitely usable for a casual player.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed a small laptop to run linux for some couch programming. It seems perfect for that purpose. I'm dropping one star due to it not supporting the 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution as stated on the details page.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought 3 of these for my siblings for high-school. Perfectly compact, easy to carry around, but not too small so that you can`t view the screen. I didn`t try to set up any gaming on them, but probably won`t as there isn`t a lot of space, probably not a big enough screen or hard drive for gaming, but I could be wrong. Overall great little laptops, great for teens or students.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this so I would have a small computer to take with me to write and surf elsewhere. I work in my office all day and didn't want to stay in there after work on the desktop. Just a reliable laptop for word processing and occasional surfing. It's perfect for those needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this laptop so I would have something to work on while I moved before I get my office set up. First, this thing is tiny. It also comes with Office 365 which is a plus. If you need something temporary, or just something cheap, this is a good laptop for you.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great little laptop. Don't expect to be playing games on this though it is designed for remote working and light video watching. I upgraded Windows s to Windows home, then I booted to USB and did a clean install of Windows 10 home. This took off all the stuff that I don't like about buying a assembly line product, so after that it was great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had no problems with this computer and have been particularly happy with the battery life.  I have only owned it for a few weeks but so far it has performed very well.  Downloading seems a bit slow but that may also be due to my internet provider.  I am happy with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Buy it for the price and size. The screen leaves a little to be desired. I bought this to run along-side my gaming DAW desktop, and it`s fantastic as a 2nd screen that has little real estate and can be placed just about anywhere. Love the 11 size.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift a few months ago. It was a nightmare to watch him use his original laptop (considering I work in tech). It still does not operate at the ideal speed I would prefer. However, like I said, it is a simple laptop for those doing simple work.","positive":1},{"review":"  Amazing deal for this little powerful guy. I do YouTube videos and edit a lot so I needed something with good power, and this is one of the smallest if not the smallest laptop I`ve ever had and it`s great. I love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Do not buy. I should have checked the reviews. After three hours of use, I was not allowed to enter the PIN. Tried hard restart and refresh and the whole shooting match.","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros: sound quality is pretty good. Lightweight and small. The contrast and color have much to be desired. I wish I spent a few dollars more for a better screen, but it's not bad for what I need.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s a very basic tiny laptop.  I wanted a Lenovo 2 in 1 but the one ordered arrived with 4 keys that didn`t function.  The entire shell feels very cheap.  It will probably be fine for what I bought it for ( reading and storing old business emails ) but I`ll never love it.","positive":0},{"review":"  It already started with it's very flimsy design of the laptop. Then, after logging in for ten minutes of unnecessary time, it presented account making errors and couldn't download even Google Chrome. Don't get this. While versatile and good looking, it isn't even worth the posted price at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer is ok. I really wish I would have read the reviews better and more of the detail. I bought it for school, because it's all I can afford for now. I will be getting something better down the road when I have more money though.","positive":0},{"review":"  The power switch was erratic, often not powering the computer on. Now the Motherboard has to be replaced. The failure of a two month old computer is something I have never experienced. I am waiting for the repair shop to complete their evaluation of all that is wrong.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great when it works and was the ideal little laptop to take on business trips.  BUT...","positive":0},{"review":"  I seen the bad reviews but there were more good than bad so I purchased. This was in JUNE. A freaking refurbished laptop would've lasted longer than that. Don't waste your money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great for taking minutes at work and the keys are easy to use. However, the internet speed is slower than dial up and it's to time consuming to use for internet research. Returning.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an overall great laptop for the purpose in which I purchased it--writing documents. My biggest complaint is that the mouse seems to be a bit wonky. The only other minor tweek I believe it could really benefit from adding a back light for the keyboard. I'm a writer, and write primarily in the dark at night, as do many other writers, so a backlight is significantly appreciated.","positive":0},{"review":"  She really likes it, it came with Microsoft 365 on it & it works perfectly, she uses it to surf the internet, store files and so much more. Her needs were meet after purchasing this and she is getting the things she needed to get done online with this stream book. She Highly recommends this stream book especially if your on a budget.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great size and does not take up much space. Batterie life last about 12 hours depending on what I am doing and how many thing I am doing at once. Great for a starter computer and to see if it will be worth spending the money to upgrade to a bigger screen, hardware, hard drive, CPU, and other functions. I will be upgreading to a better Laptop that will be with me and this on will stay at my 2nd jobs desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  The product arrived on time and as described.  This was a replacement laptop for my pre-teen and it works pretty well for her to do her schoolwork online. She also uses it to play Roblox and has no lagging issues. I intend to get a 128 GB mini sim card to boost storage but this little machine is compact and can easily be taken with her anywhere she goes.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this notebook, very lightweight and easy to use. I like the features it comes with, although I did update to windows home. The wifi in those places is much faster than I get at home, but it is what it is. Primary use is as a back up or for traveling, so it's OK for use in those situations.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far it`s exactly what I was looking for. Small, light, and extremely portable. So far I`m psyched about the purchase. Will update review in a few weeks.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was my first laptop and I just love this. My daughter set my laptop up and was able to switch it from Windows S so I can put my anti virus on my laptop. The pages run quickly.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I retired I no longer needed a full size computer. I bought this little guy for ease of carry on trips, but still accommodate printing and other peripherals. It was also priced right. It does the trick and I would recommend it to anyone who travels and needs  an easy to carry computer that provides excellent functionality.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am so thoroughly pleased with my purchase, I cannot likely begin to adequately cover it to make the point I optimally would about the darling thing. It is powerful, small, lightweight, easy-to-use anywhere and more. If you want a perfect laptop to carry with you when preferred, this is the one - and for the price. It's great even at a much higher one, so that is just ANOTHER gift.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this when the pandemic first started here because we were going to start working remotely and it has not disappointed. The screen is great quality, the keyboard isn't too tightly fit and my fat fingers doesn't hit random letters, the webcam is clear for Zoom calls, and the batter basically lasts forever. It was one of the best purchases I've made.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this computer strictly to use as an affordable music server and to watch the occasional movie.  For this purpose it works nicely.  For more serious applications I would spend another few hundred for a computer with a faster processor and more memory.Also, forget about gaming since its processor is too slow for it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this as a small laptop I can take and do work away from home.  It would be great with the free year of office365--its not really office365---you HAVE TO BE ONLINE to use it.  You can't even type in the excel or edit an existing word doc unless you are connected to the internet.  They should update the description to microsoft lite or whatever it is.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my daughter to use at college.  She used it for one semester with no issues apparent..no response.","positive":0},{"review":"  Computer was great at first. Mouse pad started to just not work after a month and a half. Now the arrow just randomly stops and if you lightly smack the touch pad (which eventually gets tiring) the mouse starts working great again. Wont buy this computer again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Despite an obvious defect in the laptop that was delivered to me and discovered immediately, the customer service did not respond properly. They tried to refer to some unrelated issues instead of simply providing a refund. Even though they got the returned laptop no refund is issued so far.","positive":0},{"review":"  It only worked for 3 days.. Then computer would not respond to clicks. Now I know what brand never to buy again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not a touch screen, cannot use Chrome. I can't review anything else because I'm too disappointed I was misled. I don't know if this is Amazon being wonky or if the seller is. I AM considering a return, as the laptop has all these apps for touch screen (including on screen keyboard) but no touch screen functionality.","positive":0},{"review":"  I initially liked everything about this computer. Unfortunately, just a few months in and I am having problems. This computer is now worthless to me. Very disappointed and going to spend the extra money to buy a Mac.","positive":0},{"review":"  Gave it to my daughter for her 13th birthday September 24th today October 6th it stopped working. Won`t turn on won`t charge.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought used in original packaging. I usually have no problem with Amazon reissuing items that were returned.

I`ve owned other laptops and the battery stay charged for at least three days before charging it again.  Don`t recommend this unless it`s only at a desk and stays plugged the whole time.  Then what`s the point in it being a laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  it is not a touch screen. you can not download google chrome onto this computer. if you don`t mind using internet explorer or firefox this is the computer for you.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a decent computer that serves as a video loop for our Food truck. It is a basic computer, that will meet the needs of a basic user. I will recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this little computer. Its small but packed with very useful apps and bells and whistles. As a author its great to just speak my mind and it catches it an keeps up with me. It linked with my cloud from my old computer and my phone and loaded up all my data on its own.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very nice for the price. The power of a PC in a small and lightweight package. But the power supply is not heavy to just take with. All in all, it's working well and my tablets are just collecting dust now.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good speed, works fine, can do Zoom classes and homework.  The touch pad can be a little sensitive at times, but overall works as it should.  Battery life is good and lasts the entire day.","positive":1},{"review":"  great value for the money... use it for email, web, word, zoom, etc.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is a little slower than I expected, but I'm not a Gamer and I don't watch videos or put any heavy use on it. Honestly, I pay bills, cruise the internet, check my email, do a little research. It is light, charges quickly, and does everything I need it for. When I'm ready to replace it I will invest in a little more speed, but for now, I'm very happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased two of these for my 7 and 9 year olds after the schools closed for COVID19, so they could remote learn, and do educational games (Khan Acadamy, Prodigy, etc.).  They work great for them.  One of the computers had an issue with the mic not working, but I got an exchange with no problem.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice little home PC.  To look stuff up, pay bills, manage accounts, shop, surf, social media, etc.  Mines an Amazon Warehouse purchase, $150 bucks, cant beat it..","positive":1},{"review":"  After 6 months it stopped working as of today because doesn't come on or anything. It sad because this laptop was portable to carry around and performanced efficiently with power points, Mircosoft word, emails and so on. I had to take it to the tech shop to get it charged again. Which works fine now.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you love chasing a wandering cursor around and if you don't mind that the cursor strays from where you left it, perhaps you'll like this.  I am considering throwing it out.  I bought it because my old laptop needed a Windows version update.

I tried to stress the laptop by playing some genuine 4k content off my hard drive (1:1 4k BDs), while having some Chrome tabs opened, and this laptop handled that like a champ.To sum it up, unless you're attempting to render Pixar's next film or trying to break military-grade encryption by brute force, this laptop will be just fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  I received it today.

The screen quality is very good.

If while wearing your fancy sunglasses indoors the laptop screen malfunctions, take your fancy glasses off and all will work OK.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wrote a negative review (below) when I first bought this PC, citing its useless bloatware from Microsoft and its partners.  I was also frustrated initially by slow page loads, until I realized that the PC was going through lengthy software updates.

The machine is great looking and the screen is very nice.  If it comes back with the 10s version, I will probably wipe the drive and install a fresh 64 bit version of Windows 10 and wait until Gates and company can create some new version of pain to inflict upon us.Bottom line - great machine that is saddled with ill-prepared software from a company that should do better.","positive":0},{"review":"  I see most people buying Ryzen version.

Normally, you have to hold \"Fn\" and hit an F key to use the function, but it was reversed on this machine.

Hoping this ACER will fill it's shoes.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this deal of the day for my son as he goes away to college in the Fall. It has a good display and backlit keyboard but memory resources are lacking which would be expected at this price point. It does have some bloat ware which I would recommend removing especially if you don't add a HDD. I would recommend this laptop for students or anybody that just wants a solid entry level computer that is expandable.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nothing here to fall in love with except maybe the price. The GPU appears to reserve 1GB of the available 4GB installed memory, the system will have near to 3GB available when operating. Everything has to be Microsoft approved and from the Microsoft store. Thankfully, switching out of S mode is easy, then this will be a normal Win10 PC.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this 4 days ago. Charged it, set it up, played around a little bit that night. The only way you can return it through Amazon is if it's unopened and not used. I will update on how this process goes.","positive":0},{"review":"  My laptop died the first week of COVID lockdown.

We immediately upgraded to 16GB ram, and installed Autodesk Inventor on it, which also ran superbly the couple of times it has been used so far.  What in the world could explain this.  Preparing to update the BIOS as a precaution, but I don't see this issue listed in any bios release notes.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my kids. It`s nice and smooth.

I bought this to replace an old Dell Latitude, and I have mixed feelings.  If you plan on leaving this on your desk, it's probably a good deal.  but if you plan to use this on your lap and take it with you places, it's probably not hardy enough for that life.","positive":0},{"review":"  Looking at all of the good reviews this laptop got and for the low price. I figured why not. Between the product and customer service, no thanks.Next time, I will spend the extra money and get a good laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was so psyched to buy this computer and just as disappointed when I got it. New computers always take time to set up granted, I had a lot of trouble with this one.The computer came already loaded I think it's called s mode but I didn't know how to use that so I got rid of that and quite frankly to try to maneuver around without pop ups who knows what else is going on I'm uncomfortable using it I don't think this is a particularly good by even though it didn't cost the whole lot I think computers need to just evolve into better tablets or something different like that I never buy a laptop again ever. I was so excited but now I'm so sorry.","positive":0},{"review":"  I didn't expect much from this laptop - considering its price, it would be unrealistic. But one of the criteria to make a final decision when buying this particular item, was a battery life - it was promised at least 8 hr of off-wire.5 hr (I checked), but 4 months passed and - it barely stays 3 hr or less. Also, when the laptop is on, the bottom part in the upper middle heats up too much - I guess it is where the battery is located.","positive":0},{"review":"  The sound thru the \"realtec\" speakers was never loud enough to hear if not positioned right on the laptop. Through headphone the sound is fine. I was lucky as mine lasted 3 months, (well without full sound that is).

Add 4-8GB more of RAM and a 1TB hard drive (easy enough to do) and this laptop will give you just about all you need short of medium-hard gaming.  For those having problems switching out of S mode, the most common mistake is not validating your version of Win 10.  Validate first while in S mode, then switch out (most how-to websites are showing you how to switch out after Win 10 has been validated).","positive":1},{"review":"  Okay so my old HP Chromebook broke and I start School in the fall, so I needed a laptop ASAP.

I'll update if I have any issues but so far I'm in love.","positive":1},{"review":"  What at first sight caught my attention was the design of this laptop, minimalist to put it in some way, having it in my hands because I am not disappointed at all, the build quality is good for a laptop of this price (I acquired it  for $ 309.99 dollars), the touchpad is of a considerable size because it allows you to navigate freely and the gestures, are quite intuitive, the bad thing that you notice is that you click manually (if you prefer since it is better to do it through the configuration of two fingers  ) The touchpad is perceived loose, cleaning it shows as if it moved to the sides.)On the Switch out of S mode (or similar) page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button. After you see a confirmation message on the page, you'll be able to install apps from outside of the Microsoft Store.","positive":1},{"review":"  After a lot of research and watching youtube videos that did pro con reviews on this Acer laptop, I decided to make the plunge. We only needed the laptop for work, so there will be no graphic intensive applications and no gaming on  it either. I have an iPad if I feel the need to use my finger instead of my mouse. In all, a great budget laptop that will do all that we need it to do, Loving it so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  Buy this computer if you need a really great, full HD screen and a capable computer to do surfing, microsoft office sort of tasks, watching netflix, etc. Becomes a snappy surfing and binge watching champion if you throw an extra 4gb of memory in it and another SDD for storing your files.

It doesn't feel slow, it feels high quality: it is one of the best laptops I've ever owned.Still, for the price, this laptop deserves 5 stars in my opinion because I was expecting way less.If you're getting this, I would suggest you add an SSD drive for greater storage, and upgrade the ram for better performance while using hungry applications.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I just grabbed this lap top on an prime day special.

The specifications were hard to beat and so when everything was up and running I was happy. Be warned - I am an IT professional with 20+ years - the allure of good specs, low price = you better make sure you have a plan to have it repaired or be able to return it. We ended up buying just one more expensive laptop that both my kids can use (another ACER by the way) and have had zero issues in several months.","positive":0},{"review":"  CPU is i3, third generation, which isn`t capable of supporting virtual background.

The laptop arrived in a very large box with the laptop in its box rattling around with just one little piece for protection.The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the difference between \"S\" and \"home\" should be explained to the consumer w o having to look in the comments section, as well as an explanation that the \"S\" version means you have to use applications and not programs.

At minimum the memory should be upgraded to really make this a great machine, the cheapest upgrade is a single 4GB DDR4-2400 memory stick that would double the memory and enable dial channel operation for a nice performance boost. The processor is pretty fast, on par with Intel Core i3 netbooks, and the integrated  Radeon graphics easily beats the integrated graphics in Intel chips, especially with the upgraded dual channel memory, but obviously this is not a gaming laptop.Pros: Great price, upgradable memory (32GB should work), upgradable 2280 NVMe SSD, empty 2.","positive":1},{"review":"  I did what a lot of other people did.

Acer said that fixing the screen was an out-of-warranty repair, despite the fact that the laptop was never once dropped or had any damage done to it by me (probably to get out of having to eat the cost of the repair).

I`d first like to say this is most definitely the best budget friendly laptop and I see why it`s the best seller also. The only con I have to say about this laptop which isn`t that big of a deal to me is the built in speaker quality sounds pretty poor and built in camera is also pretty poor.

Hope this tip can help others.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a \"senior\" that is not a techie so I can't share any technical information.

Besides for \"Zooming,\" I plan to use it for traveling.  For all other uses, I will continue using my desktop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this laptop because my old one (HP) died. Based on the reviews I decided to try it.  It was a very nice feature and I was very disappointed when it failed.  Of course it waited to fail until after the 30 day return period.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a gaming computer and just wanted a simple laptop to do some design work and work related projects on the side. It can handle older games pretty well and emulators or course, but that's not the purpose.

This is excellent value for money. (Hold F2 and power of the laptop to enter BIOS)3.

Forgot to mention the keyboard, it's illuminated which is really great and something my \"twice as expensive laptop from three years back doesn't even have\".In summary, this laptop is incredible value for money and really stands out from the competition as a bargain.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this on a one-day \"Flash Sale\", and I had the choice of Intel or AMD,  NVidia, Intel UHD or Vega3 graphics.I chose the least-expensive option - AMD Ryzen 3 with Vega-3 graphics.

I've had it 31 days and during that time the cursor operated by the touchpad was sensitive and stopped working all together. I'll have to spend additional time doing this and then waiting to get it back. Not happy.","positive":0},{"review":"  In all fairness, I cannot give much of a review. I followed the instructions and plugged in the computer. It was a short in the computer. This is the second Acer product that I have purchased and have had to return because it would not operate when it was brand new.","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved the overall look and response of this laptop.  Then the problems started.  I returned the computer for another brand and model.  We'll have to see how it works out.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0I bought this computer about 9 months ago and have had problems with it from the start. First, the screen would get semi-black for a few seconds at a time and the web browser would need to be refreshed. WILL NEVER BUY ACER AGAIN. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have a very cheap Chromebook that's MUCH better at surfing the web than this thing. My $20 phone has no problem. This thing just randomly loses internet connection, and just about the time I'm ready to complain to my ISP, I try some other device = NO PROBLEM. So it's just this garbage machine.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am beginning to wonder about appliances bought on Amazon. A rice cooker I ordered could NOT be plugged into a wall outlet...","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this computer and loaded all my college links on it.  I was okay with it, although the speakers are TERRIBLE and turned all the way up will not let you hear anything.  I chose to return it instead and buy the HP, with awesome speakers and a good keyboard.  Don't waste your money on this computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this on January 15 and loved it until today when for no apparent reason, the sound stopped working. I can hear it with headphones but not with speakers. I have had this less than a month and have taken good care of it. I shouldn't already have to send it in for repairs.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had problems with this Acer laptop from the very beginning.  When using the keyboard, the cursor will occasionally jump to another line of text, and sometimes highlight and delete at will.  If I could give it 0 stars, I'd do so.  One star is far to good of a rating.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great laptop at this price point. What makes this such a good value is Acer makes several versions of this. If in the market for a sleek and stylish BASIC laptop that doesn't look or feel like a budget unit and with all the modern hardware and software inside, you can do worse. But certainly no better.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm really impressed with this laptop. First off, the build quality is really solid and premium feeling. Highly recommend if you understand at least a little bit about computers, upgrading, etc. If you don't know what an Operating System is, and can't change settings, and can't upgrade memory, etc, then maybe look at a different model.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Laptop is fantastic for what I paid for it.  I must say first, however, that I haven't even tried booting it up with the stock 4gb of ram installed.Long story short I love this laptop and I`m sure you will too as long as you take my advice and upgrade the ram. If you`re not up for doing that, find a similar system with more ram.","positive":1},{"review":"  Received it just recently.Well packaged and protected, exactly as described, looks sturdy with this brushed aluminum look, looks more expensive than what you actually pay for. If you don't expect wonders from a budget laptop like this, then certainly you would not go wrong with this piece. Recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  After an unfortunate accident with my far more expensive and fairly new laptop, I needed one to use in the meantime until I could save up enough and or sell a kidney to replace it.I didn't have high hopes based on the price.You're obviously not going to get some superior quality computer in this price range, but for a few hundred dollars, it's worth it and it does what you need it to do. I've since replaced my other laptop but I'm still keeping this one as a backup.","positive":1},{"review":"  Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop, 15.6 inches Full HD IPS Display, AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, Vega 3 Graphics, 4GB.Some people complained about the fan being loud - it might be a little louder than other laptop's fans, but is really not an issue - some people just make a big deal over little things.Highly recommend this Acer laptop, is solid.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an amazing laptop for the price. I bought it for college class use.I would recommend this laptop to my friends, my colleagues, and my customers. Great Job Acer.","positive":1},{"review":"  After owning this laptop for 5 months this is my review.(A quick note) If you are looking for the memory you need to upgrade search Amazon for\" CT8G4SFS8266\" you'll find the Crucial 8GB Single DDR4 2666 MT s which is perfect for this laptop.I can't say enough good things about this deal at this price.Thumbs Up - 5 Star product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Don't worry, there is a fix for that.  I immediately removed the stock M.  If you must play something, you may be better suited to download an emulator for a gameboy or something similar and play a rom.

Still, I'm happy with the performance of the laptop. Especially for three Benjamin.","positive":1},{"review":"  The computer worked great for about 3 months then the mouse pad stopped working.

You'll regret it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is really an \"I just need my email to work\" pc.

Purchased March 15th. STAY AWAY FROM THIS LAPTOP..","positive":0},{"review":"  I liked the weight, size speed and looks. However my unit would not resume from wake with lid opening or sleep button pressed, or power button pushed again. Returned unit for refund. Usually not this negative but this unit wasted to much of my time.","positive":0},{"review":"  Day1. Windows crashes, the laptop won't power down. We were told to clear our personal information on their own and Amazon does not do that for returned laptops.Get a different laptop, even if it is $100 more.","positive":0},{"review":"  I tried 3 of them they perform differently from each other and they appeared to have different hardware suppliers internal parts made by random manufacturers for example M.2 port is only PCIE X2 speed  and advertised internal sata3 port performs about 300mb write and 500mb read on a drive rated 530mb write 550mb read.Over it looks as if it was put together in a hurry debris around plastic body can easily can cut hands skin etc.","positive":0},{"review":"  Adding hard drive and additional memory was fairly easy (take out screws from back, remember you have only one open slot for memory if you plan to keep the 4GB memory already installed). Converting win 10S to home is also very straight forward. Very tight and needing some force to pull out usb sticks, something I am afraid to eventually break the ports for the long run. Not so impressed with the overall build quality (fairly cheap material and make, obvious when I took the back cover to upgrade memory).","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall, a great laptop for the price. I added 8G of RAM really easily...","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop stopped working only a month or two after I purchased it along with the warranty. I never dropped it, spilled anything on it, did not damage it in any way. Do not waste your money, please. Now I need to decide wh err then yo take this somewhere or buy an entire other laptop and am broke.","positive":0},{"review":"  ***$350.00 AT TIME OF PURCHASE***As far as basic laptops go, this model is very good. Adding another 4GB stick of RAM and more storage will cost you an extra $75.00+ (depending on storage capacity) but it's worth it in my opinion and I highly recommend it if you decide to purchase this laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've owned several laptops previous to buying this highly rated Acer.  Two were HP's and the sound absolutely died and were unfixable and since I watch a lot of painting tutorials I needed one that had decent sound.  I just got it a few days ago, so I am hoping it continues to not give me any issues.  If it does, I will edit this review .","positive":1},{"review":"  I was expecting a delay but gladly they made it on time. The product is super smooth and well packed. Thanks Amazon for my first experience buying in your platform. You've done a great job.","positive":1},{"review":"  When shopping for a laptop, there are a lot of options and I usually tell people who ask for my advice to try and get the best you can afford.. Overall, I can see why this is a top seller on Amazon, but in the end, if you want an \"out of the box\" experience that just gets you up and running quickly, you should really look at upping your budget. If you want a backup laptop for travelling, and are willing to put in a bit more money and time into getting the performance up to speed (literally), then this is probably best laptop value on Amazon right now.","positive":1},{"review":"  The quality of this laptop is top notch. The screen is a nice size. I really love the how thin and sleek the machine itself is. One thing I would have liked is to have a Blu Ray reader for my old BluRay and DVDs.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my daughters 10th bday, she uses an iPhone, iPad, and desktop to play games. She is a very fast typer and very adept with technical things (when it has to do with a game of course).I got the extra 4GB of RAM as recommended, installed with ease, and it runs fast. Decent priced laptop with a beautiful FULL HD screen, everything checked out good on benchmarking especially graphics as this has its own dedicated chip for graphics, unlike the integrated 630's you see, which do not do much, as in there is no video editing etc, but with this one, shes all good.","positive":1},{"review":"  Had to see what all the hype was about when this puppy went on sale for Black Friday, and being a big AMD laptop fan, gave it a spin. The screen on this thing is by far the most impressive feature, I was really surprised at how well it looked and how crisp it was. Acer has always been a reliable brand for me. Cheers.","positive":1},{"review":"  Follow-up Review:I've had this laptop for more than two months, and I am still impressed by this purchase.The laptop is very reliable, and has good (not great) battery time, and a great display.g. brightness, volume, disabling touchpad, wi-fi off, etc.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this computer urgently because I am working remotely and my current tablet just could not handle 8 hours of consistent work time.  So Far, this was a very easy set up. Excellent computer so far especially for the money. I purchased this  strictly for remote access and will continue to use my Surface tablet for personal use since the touch screen is a nice feature.","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely love this laptop so far. It starts up super quick, probably 5 or 10 seconds from when you push the power key. We got this on Prime Day so it was an even better price than it`s normal price, but even the normal price is great for this computers features. It comes with Cortana which helps you set it up, but you can always turn her off.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really wanted to love this. I`ve only had it for about a week and I`m having issues.Other than the lag when doing my homework (which is what I use it for most), I love the colors on the screen, the size and everything else about this thing. I hate that it isn`t touch like my old one, but I`ll get use to it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unfortunately I guess I'm the first one to buy a faulty laptop of this kind - with so many other positive reviews. This laptop only lasted me 5 months before the screen went completely black and now it will not turn on. And since I'm well past the return date - I have to chalk this up as a loss. Horrible quality laptop that I will not buy again.","positive":0},{"review":"  The charger buzzes like a fridge and heats up A LOT.The main problem is that you can do NOTHING on your own.  Please don't.  You'll send it back just like I'm about to.","positive":0},{"review":"  I would not recommend this laptop.  After just two months of basic usage (no gaming, no power using), I lost all audio function.  From reading online troubleshooting guides, this appears to be a somewhat common issue for users of this type of laptop.Will not purchase this brand again.","positive":0},{"review":"  The Acer 5 is a fine laptop as long as you do not need to use the speakers (extreme low volume) or use WiFi sharing (The shared WiFi connection consistently suffers interruptions). Ethernet is the only viable option for sharing internet connection from the Acer 5.00 taxes and handling = 400.00 bad buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop has some good features, the sound and screen are excellent.  The problem is that it is a nightmare to recharge.  I even bought another one of this to make sure that I had the right charger and charger did not work well.I am very frustrated because this has a great price but the charger issue is very serious.","positive":0},{"review":"  Less than two months old and the screen just completely stopped working. No damage, didn't drop it, it just broke. Troubleshooting was ineffective and tech support was extremely difficult to understand due to language barrier and heavy accent. Sent it in for repair and they wanted to charge the same price to repair it as a new computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  In less than a year, the screen gave the dreaded Black Screen of Death.  Now I'm on the hook for a new replacement screen.","positive":0},{"review":"  pros. price. the main keys work great, feel good for book righting. shorten the right enter keys , to allow num keys to be 1 8 th in bigger.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this same laptop last fall and have had no issues with it. I bought another one in late February, and since I have had it, the earphone plug has worked twice. I realize this is most likely attributed to the Coronavirus and the company may be shut down. I need this laptop to work.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was way cheaper than other laptops I looked at, including its own successor, which is a big reason why I got it. Screen is clear. Windows Updates are riddled with yellow \"Warning.\" messages but again that's probably my stalker's doing, not Acer's.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very pleased with my purchase and would buy this laptop again. It's a good price for a good computer.-side of the screen gets fingerprint smudges easily when adjusting the angle or closing (but this gets wiped up pretty quickly if you have the right cloth).-not a lot of memory and ram space, but that doesn't really bother me.","positive":1},{"review":"  We've been using this for our children's schoolwork during the pandemic, and it's held up remarkably well to kids that are less-than-gentle to their electronics. My wife is able to use it for general work-related tasks as well and is beefy enough to handle it while being lightweight enough that it's not a chore to lug around. If you're hoping to play intensive games or other powerful programs on it, this probably isn't the laptop for you, but for general everyday purposes it does the job quite well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had my new computer for about a week now and am really pleased with this selection. It is fast and sharp.  It is certainly annoying to get the popups on my old excel and word office documents trying to get me to purchase Office 365 but I am going to use the free Office Trio.  I do not game so cannot address that but for my purposes and at this price point, it is  a very good value .","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a student..feels like I should have paid a lot more. Only reason I can't give it five start is because I'm still getting used to the mouse pad placement and I can't help but compare it to higher end, much more expensive machines.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this. I have an HP that is SO slow and would take forever to do anything. Over all it's a great little computer. A great buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just wanted a basic, inexpensive laptop for going back to school part-time. I just really need something that I can use to write papers, use Microsoft Office on, and take notes. I am keeping in mind that I can upgrade my hard drive and RAM someday when things start to slow down, and if I start to require heavier usage out of this laptop. But, I'm very happy with the price point and quality, and glad I have the choice to upgrade features in the future.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop has al you need. SSD - fast boot times. For gaming, the graphics card is not the best so i dont recommend it for serious gaming but for normal gaming with lesser loads it works like a charm. Great value laptop for the price, still cant believe the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this laptop on prime day for roughly 250ish after using rewards points and deal of the day. i put a second ssd into i had lying around and a second stick of ram for a total of 8 gigs this display is easily the best part of this machine. i put world of warcraft on it and with every thing turned down pretty low it runs at an average of 40 fps at 1080p in lfr raid situation. for this price you cannot come close to something like this anywhere else it's simply beautiful.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I got the Acer Aspire because I already had an Acer for 4 years and then it started giving trouble.I saw the reviews for this and decided to get one because it is 1080 HD display...","positive":1},{"review":"  After about 9 months of light use (med student) this laptop is already shutting down on its own, freezing, and screen is not turning on (all in the absence of any viruses).","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought it for my son who's in high school as a Christmas present last year.  All was well until he put his thumb on the edge of the keyboard then closing the lid.. Flimsy, flimsy, FLIMSY.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the laptop for home use . The day I opened it was too slow too start . Not sure where the rest of the $17 is going ..","positive":0},{"review":"  I'd like to start off by saying for those that say this device has excellent RGB color output, please and I mean please GET YOUR EYES CHECKED. We as humans can distinguish colors from a pretty young age, so when I saw the orange coloring of everything that was supposed to be red, I figured I might've gotten a dud, a bad apple if you will..Also there are no CAP LOCK NUM LOCK notifications, but turn on the Sticky keys sounds and you'll be fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is some S Windows mode. Can't do any computing, can't install any apps, unless you buy them for a ransom price from Microsoft store.This is nothin short of modern day enslavement. The 'subscription' is your modern bondage.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have probably the simplest cheapest wireless printer HP makes. Getting the Acer Aspire to print was impossible. Now I'm waiting for an independent technician  ( from HelloTech) to come to my house to try to get it running at a cost of $103. VERY angry and disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  First and foremost - THERE'S NO CAPS LOCK INDICATOR ANYWHERE. I can tell you now, this seemingly minor inconvenience really does get annoying quickly.This is definitely a budget laptop, so if you're looking for a $300 laptop that you just need to do the basics on, this will definitely get you through it. But if you're using this daily, typing consistently, I would consider upping the budget and getting something a little better than this.","positive":0},{"review":"  Editing initial review - worked great when it was new. Now that it is a couple months old it is frustrating. They are on the bottom of the laptop, and even at full volume still a little quiet. But other than that no complaints whatsoever.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have only had this laptop for a few months. I`m older and don`t use computers frequently. A new computer that is rarely used should not have this problem.  Now after paying so much for a new computer I`m going to have to pay someone to fix it.","positive":0},{"review":"  to the reviewer that said it runs League of Legends amazing. this is simply not true. i solved this by just packing an old usb keyboard in my work bag.It really is a nice little laptop for the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't use the internet for work anymore, I'm retired.  But I wanted a backlit keyboard (woo hoo) without paying $1,000 and decent memory to play simple computer games.NOTE - WHY CABLE VERSUS WIRELESS -- I used ethernet cable so did not do wireless at ALL on the set up.  There are 20 modems with 5G within reach of this laptop -- it weakens the signal for me to use wireless inside my apartment per Sparklight technical support.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this computer for studying and research. I do watch movies and play music on it.. no lie.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have owned uncountable computes since I bought my fist Apple \"pizza box\" desktop computer in 1993.  In our household, we use computers for work, internet access, email, photo and word processing, and (particularly for me) musical notation and audio playback.  I suspect this Acer will last no longer and maybe not nearly as long.  But at the price, we will be quite happy to get two or three years out of these machines.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for a low-cost computer for linux use.  This model was appealing because (1) it has a 1080p display, and most cheap laptops still have 768 line displays.All in all, it is a great laptop for linux work.  Purchasing an SSD might make the installation job easier.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer works great, especially for the price.

Would recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  When school went remote, my daughter used her iPad to complete online assignments. For the most part that worked but because some items needed to be submitted via Google Classroom we came across some formatting issues. I expect that this device will last for years to come if it is still made with the same quality my Acer desktop.OK, and here is a word from my daughter on this: I love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is light and sleek with an elegant, appealing design. I find its performance impressive because of the speed with which it accesses information on the web, email, and documents. The description is accurate for this laptop, and I mention this because it is such a hassle to have to repack and ship off an item because of inaccurate description. Overall, this computer is an excellent buy when compared to its more expensive competitors.","positive":1},{"review":"  Easy set up, easily transferred out of 'S Mode' into Windows 10 Home (Pro only available with $99 payment). Boot up is almost instant (5 seconds +- .  For the price, I'm not sure how one could do much better. I'm pleased.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed to get a general use laptop for home.  Even though I'm really geeky, I hadn't bought a new personal laptop for home since 2009.I definitely recommend this laptop for general usage.  It's tough to beat the price   feature combination it offers.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop for my business as a sort of mobile operations center.

The mouse pad would not work.  No packing but two brown pieces of paper.  A shame to send a breakable item this way.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this as it was mentioned #1 on a site listing best Under $500 gaming laptops. I was given pause that it had such low RAM (4g) but it looked easy enough to upgrade so dropped another $50 on a 16G ram set. As it is, pretty week, but if you are willing to upgrade the ram the guts become pretty solid. Everything else about it is kind bleh.","positive":0},{"review":"  Do not buy this computer.

It is nicely made and you will enjoy using it if you get a nice one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this product in June and already have the screen popped out because of bad hinges. Pretty sure I don`t have any warranty on this and would not get this disposable product again.","positive":0},{"review":"  I specifically put into the search on Amazon that I wanted a touch screen, this laptop came up as having one.

Unfortunately, this laptop is not especially designed for distance working. I've actually reverted to using my old laptop for anything I need to record and broadcast because even with it's flaws the webcam provides a much crisper picture than the one on this Acer. But, for word processing, email, and basic internet use, this Acer gets the job done.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups.

They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was nervous about ordering this Chromebook many months before arrival.

Would recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this, and a few spares, for a 'don't care what happens to it' laptop for road trips, gifts, etc.I want it to surf, play netflix, and update my social status while travelling.If you want a GOOD laptop, get a Dell XPS13 when on sale.If you need a crap-top, this is fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this. The only issue I have with it is that it is only 720P, but for a 14in screen that isn't a real big deal for me. The price is right. It's a great buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Chromebook is outstanding - perfect reminder of what a Chromebook should be (cheap, long battery, zippy web browsing, worry free usage, optimized port selection). The size is right, the keys feel great, the track pad is fine.Things I'd like to see improved:- Give me an 8GB RAM option just for kicks. 4 is fine, but RAM is cheap these days.","positive":1},{"review":"  Its a good chromebook.

For starters, I had to return the first one because the touchpad didn't work. I gave it a second chance, and this time, it was plagued with a software issue that would make my daughter have to fully log back into the computer every time it restarted, which meant that I had to log back into my account, and then do the parent approval code for her to log in.  It's a pain in the backside, and considering there are other Chromebooks at this price point that don't have these issues, there isn't much reason to get this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  Lenovo Chromebook 330S:  Excellent value for the money, wanted to replace a capable but heavy Lenovo Thinkpad that I was carrying from school to home.

It's really nice to have most of my textbooks on my laptop, and taking notes is very convenient with this Chromebook.

Even at 1080P it looks fuzzy, some of this is due to ChromeOS' poor display scaling for the User Interface, which is irrelevant to this laptop as that is something that would show up on all Chromebooks. If you are looking for a cheap solution to get you through just typing some Docs or watching Youtube videos this Chromebook may work for you but I would spend closer to 300 to have some of the issues dealt with better.

I sent it back.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was my first experience with Chrome OS.  I'm retired now and wanted to replace a Windows 7 laptop.

It's a really, really weak machine which is unfortunate but the cost is very attractive so if you can deal with not being able to do much it's a nice sleek designed laptop that functions pretty well for extremely basic tasks.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really do not understand why all the reviews of this chrome book give a crappy review when it comes the lcd.

I find nothing not to like about it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this so my wife could have her PC back.I'm writing the next great trilogy of magic realism, The Memory Tapes of John I. Basically, a plug in and play device. EASY PEASY.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a good value for a budget machine.  Its austere plastic body probably wouldn't survive much abuse but it does have a mat texture that wards off finger prints.  You can keep a separate storage space for your Linux data or \"share\" your Google Drive data with Linux.  So you can for example use Linux's Libre Office Write to open and save a file directly from to the cloud, preserving the Chrome OS thin-client motif.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this laptop for about a week or so now.

You can only print wirelessly,  no label printers, only one usb port.  Works good to go online,  very lightweight, very cheap do I'll keep it but it did not fit the small business spot I needed it.  Make sure you know what you get with a chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  No complaints. For the cost it`s a good value.  The complete inability to adjust the display quality and it`s washed out appearance make it a certain gift to someone else, not what I really needed.

My background is with PCs and I am not a fan of the scrolling on this laptop given that it does not have a touchscreen.  Hooking up a USB mouse nearly a requirement.","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price, it's hard to complain about this machine, which runs Chrome OS great. The screen, however, is hard to look at. The trackpad is as bad as you would expect for the price. At the end of the day, it's up to your own tolerances for these things, and I got this machine for a teenager, not myself, so it fits the bill fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  big miss on the screen.  The rest of the laptop is solid.  I had a Lenovo Chromebook before this, and it was great,so I'm not sure why they put this washed out mistake on here.

It's basically an Android tablet in a laptop, you use the Google Play store to install apps and its all tied in to your Android account.It run's android apps and games well, the hardware seems fairly sturdy if basic, for the price it's a great deal. Awesome if you want to give a child a laptop and not worry about them breaking a $1000 computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got those on prime day for sale for $145.

A lot of people will probably complain (unfairly) that it isn't 4k or some other such nonsense, but at the price, it's a great laprop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Screen quality is pretty bad. I guess that is due to the \"non-glare\" feature. I am always recharging. Is not worth what I paid.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop is unbelievably slow.

I want to believe that you can get a good Chromebook on a budget, and because I've had previous good experiences with the durability of Lenovo laptops.Overall, the S330 checks off all the boxes of what a Chromebook needs to do, but it made me itch for more luxurious features and a more elegant design.  It's worth taking on a test drive to see if you feel the same, or are satisfied with what it can deliver.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am new to Chromebooks, but I needed something that I could hold and surf the Internet with and just watch videos, so I thought it might fit the bill.  I really don't mind the screen at all - it's not the best, but it's perfectly fine for me.You can enable a beta version of LINUX on this Chromebook.  It runs in a virtual machine and there is a toggle switch in settings to enable that or disable it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Edit: ***Avoid at all cost.***Original: It's fine if you just need something to browse the web.

Since its 1400 dollar devices.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have bought new surface pro but having issue in browsing or opening any application.Significant slowness and internet speed always show slow while in other device with same network it works fine.Also I got blue screen 4-5 times in 2 days .Don't know issue with this device or other feel same.","positive":0},{"review":"  I want to address the CPU: It has great potential, but all the potential in the world is useless when in practice, it isn't realized.That's exactly the case of this Surface Pro 7. Not portable, but it's a total beast of a system for 4K video editing in DaVinci Resolve. God bless.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got it this week. Crashed or froze 3 times the first day.Thanks Microsoft, Amazon, Jeff MFing Bezos. Nothing I love more than firing out $1200 for a brick.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to like it, but unfortunately the network issues are making this computer very unreliable. Suddenly the network card stops responding, and it makes the mobility part of the table laptop almost useless, because I have to watch out and see if when I disconnect the power cord or something else, to take it from my office to downstairs, the network is still there or whether I have to start troubleshooting it, often rebooting it and closing all my open apps. when I could've used it for an external mouse. I hope Microsoft and Intel can make this work, but until then my 1 star review will stay.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought bundled but keyboard connection was inconsistent.  SP7  had to be restarted all the time to use the keyboard and disconnects after a a few minutes, SP7 was later determined defective not the keyboard.  The new replacement SP7 paint job is noticeably better coating since it's holding well after a week use.  0 star for Microsoft poor production quality control but 5 stars for the customer service provided by Microsoft Westfield Topanga Canyon store for offering the replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is decently powerful, I wouldn't try to go full bore on 4k video editing, or rendering 3d models. But for light photo editing and little work projects day to day productivity, it is great..IDK but so far Im enjoying this wonderful little device.","positive":1},{"review":"  That 17yr old finally Expressed an interest in something and after much review it was discovered this is the best system for my little artist who will begin drawing thumbnails online and getting paid for it.  Lets pray.  Had to buy the pen separate as well as Office 365 and the warranty  but it was all worth it. Good buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had the surface pro 3 for years prior to this. I decided to upgrade and I'm glad I did. The fact you can change from a solid laptop to a solid tablet within seconds is incredible. I have had good luck with Microsoft products and so far this is the same.","positive":1},{"review":"  Before purchasing this I was going to buy the Dell XPS 13 2020 model because of the ultra portable design, but it was $300-$400 more. So I decided to buy the SP7 and I really enjoy it. With my screen settings on low, I squeezed out 7 hours out of the battery with only doing homework online. Other than bezel and battery, I still recommend this to anybody.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was a little concerned about liking this.  Haven't worked on a 12.  The i7 version with 16GB RAM is ample and it is highly responsive and fast - even in comparison to my heavy duty i9 laptop.  A bit pricey - but in this case you get what you pay for.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my upgrade from surface pro 3. It is and upgrade by any measure.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this laptop. I have never owned a surface pro before and now I am hooked. I opted for the payment plan and that is going well, too. Thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  so far I am really liking this Surface. I got exactly what was ordered, new and sealed in the box. I hope to figure out how to disable it because it really does not work at all. Overall, I am really happy with the tablet.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been working on MS Windows since it was born.  The MS Surface is the best computer to use with MS Windows hands down in my opinion.  The durability is awesome.  Get a good case protector ( I use the UAG and it rocks) and get the Microsoft keyboard and a screen protector.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was unlucky enough to receive a product with a faulty screen initially.  This is upsetting and fear inducing - what with the investment involved - but overall Amazon's amazing support made it essentially painless to replace the product.  Just quality all around.  Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  No where near as good as the Surface Pro 6, and that's an understatement. Since I've this model I've had to reinstall Windows 10 six times so far...","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought my device in january after doing alot of reviews, I used to be an apple user. Everything was great with the device until 5 months later. And I hope this helped others with deciding on whether or not to buy. Otherwise the device has great screen resolution, light and compact, and very easy to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this computer and was very excited to use it. I'm a student and don't use it for anything special. By the way, I realized that it happened to many more people who bought this computer.In addition, Microsoft's service is inaccessible and I was unable to contact them to fulfill the warranty.","positive":0},{"review":"  THIS IS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT I PURCHASED THIS COMPUTER AND I WAS SO EXCITED TO USE IT, HOWEVER IT KEPT RESTARTING OUT O THE BLUE.

I WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY BECAUSE THEY'LL GIVE YOU A HORRIBLE PRODUCT AND NOT GIVE YOU A FULL REFUND.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just received it. Everything else seems to be fine except for the intense heat. They have been understanding and helpful, but overall it is still a distressing experience. Be prepared for this issue if you are interested in the Surface Pro series, since according to the Microsoft Community, similar issues have happend to Surface Pro 4, 5, 6 and 7.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Been anything but happy with this laptop. First of all battery life is horrendously low and can barely manage to finish up homework without having to charge it...","positive":0},{"review":"  I was a user of a Surface Pro 4 i5 256gb 8gbRAM and really loved it. I used it for more than 3 years. But I live abroad, so I will have to wait for 6 months till I travel to US. Good customer service though, but the product quality is way below the surface pro 4 series.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall very fast and sleek tablet. Sometimes it will get hot when running multiple applications (Ex Autocad and Adobe photoshop) Was very disappointed when I saw the black bezel had small, distinctive scratches on the bottom. I think they came from the shipping process since the box was slightly damaged when received.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was just casually using photoshop in a dry environment on 50% battery and suddenly the screen goes black and never turns back on. Charging it did nothing, it's completely dead, very disappointing for it's price.Fun to use, but would not recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had the surface pro 4 before this one and still worked great.

I look forward to loading my sheet music as pdf files and using the screen while I play the piano.","positive":1},{"review":"  First a big Thumbs-up to ProPrime and FedEx who shipped my Surface Pro 7 to the other side of the globe within 4 days of ordering - very impressed.As for the Pro 7, so far very happy.Talking of setup, this was very easy and after logging in with my Microsoft details, I was up and running within an hour.Very handy tool when meeting with clients.","positive":1},{"review":"  All was fine until one day it kept flickering on the start up Logo. It would not start up or shut off. I like the product otherwise. I'll try another, hopefully I'll get a good one.","positive":1},{"review":"  The screen is perfect size for using it as a tablet and is a okay size for using it as laptop....","positive":1},{"review":"  When I first got the surface I was worried that it would be a dud based on other customer reviews especially considering how cheap it was. And initially, I DID run into some issues on the first day because it froze randomly and shut down just as others have said. If anyone plans on buying this laptop make sure you download the correct updated drivers and it may resolve any issues that you run into. The last surface pro I had was from 2016 and it still runs pretty smoothly so I'm hoping this one lasts just as long, if not longer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pro7 is basically the best laptop and tablet combined. The picture quality is absolutely amazing.The battery life is good (not sure what people complain about) on a big screen, 3D sound and powering a fast 4K device.I totally like this thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  I liked that the product was exactly as advertised, Microsoft Surface Pro 7 with 16GB of memory and an Intel I7 processor. Setup was flawless out of the box with no issues. Very happy with the purchase and set-up. Deliver was also 2 days ahead of the promised delivery date.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is perfect for what I need.  I meet with clients daily and I need signatures so the touch screen with the pen (sold separately) and the fold back keyboard gives me the convenience of a tablet but the functionality of a laptop.  It's fast enough and easily tethers with my phone. You wont be disappointed if your thinking about getting a new system.","positive":1},{"review":"  Always liked Microsoft products. Surface Pro 7 is awesome to use and comes with great features..My son enjoyed unboxing this new Surface Pro.","positive":1},{"review":"  Had this thing for a month. Already having display issues and having to send it in for repair.  So I`ve had this replacement for days and still have no idea if it works because I can`t turn the damn thing on.  Nice.","positive":0},{"review":"  I own Surface book 2 and SP6 and bought this one for the 10th gen CPU boost and the USB C. However there are two main issues:1. There really isn't any speed boost because the SP7 i5 version throttles like crazy, especially to save battery at <30% battery level, it throttle up to around 1.8ghz and all the way to 800mhz.","positive":0},{"review":"  Upon receiving the tablet and booting it up I noticed a strange flicker on the top 2 inches of the screen.It was cold outside when they delivered, so I thought maybe it just needed to warm up.I contacted amazon support about the issue and they said they would send a replacement unit right away.3 says later and still waiting for them to approve the replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is really a nice product. I love the ease of use, the design, the speed. I reluctantly returned this - buyers remorse - and purchased an open boxed, excellent condition Surface Go with mouse, keyboard and pen for a little over half the price of Pro 7 which I am finding is a suitable alternative. I wish I could have justified the cost because I like a bigger screen normally the Go is only 10\" compared to the Pro which is 12\".","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased two of these at the same time at Christmas for my sons.  The first one would boot-loop, meaning it would never boot up, right out of the box, so we returned it.  These things are trash, and now we're stuck with an almost $900 piece of unreliable junk.  AVOID and do not buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had experience with Surfaces, the freezing or not coming out of sleep is a fairly common issue.  This one started doing right out of the box, so I returned it.  It's a nice little machine, if you can get one that doesn't have that flaw.","positive":0},{"review":"  I rated everything 1 star since my new surface pro 7 will not boot up. Therefore, I can not see the screen, can not judge battery life and can not determine the value for money other than to say it appears to be a bad deal.","positive":0},{"review":"  There was no type cover as advertised and the seller wouldn't resolve this when I contacted them. The tablet itself seems okay so far but I had to buy my own type cover and the seller only refunded me fifteen dollars.","positive":0},{"review":"  Battery dies in standby, basically making it a useless product. Battery life in general is very poor, but the fact that it dies passively makes it worthless to me. As far as pen input, if the Apple Pencil is a 10 10, Surface products remain at about a 6 10. Maybe.","positive":0},{"review":"  Dislikes: little laggy: Microsoft need to improve the software so it can compeit with other tables, Dead pixel: the screen quality not good and windows tests size not fit for this type of screen sizes.Likes: light weight and small size, easy during transportation, affordable price.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is my wife's second Surface Pro.

She is also an extensive use of Iphones and Ipads.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this tablet with the intention of using it primarily for drawing and illustration. Unfortunately, I encountered a few issues that came along with that, mainly the diagonal line wobble that occurred. I'm still not sure if it was the device itself or the pen I purchased with the device but either way it was a deal-breaker for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love the surface pro. I used a 6 for work, so we decided on this one after reading lots of tech reviews. We did have to purchase Microsoft Office, but at least got a 39 day trial to begin.

Software is still very unrefined in tablet mode, apps are lacking, performance is just okay, and I think the annoyance of so many moving parts + software drama (folding unfolding kickstand + flappy type cover + pen that would fall off at times + poor palm rejection or general software bugs) just contributed to the frustration of the device.  I just want something that is wholly solid and can be used without much fuss - thus why I prefer to sacrifice any hopes of sticking with this crappy tablet experience and move on.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product itself is decent. It's not perfect, but I'm not going to pretend the hardware itself is deserving of a 1-star rating.Because of Microsoft's evident disregard for their customers, I will be returning my device to the store and replacing it with a product from a more responsive company.

There are some things I`d like to be fixed, but I wasn`t willing to spend the money for an even more expensive laptop so I feel like while it is on the costly side, it`s a huge upgrade from what I had and it`s held up great for the past 3 months.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you don't want a MacBook Air Pro because of macOS, or other Windows manufacturers such as Dell HP Lenovo have let you down in the past, the Surface Laptop 3 (i7 1065G7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Matte Black) is quite the option. In my opinion it's the best premium Ultrabook on the market, especially impressive as Microsoft has only been at it for about 3 years.Overall, I think this should be the default recommendation for a Windows Ultrabook. at $1299 for the i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD, value isn't the best but you have what is the best looking Ultrabook on the market other than the new XPS 13.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've owned the Surface Pro 1 and Surface Pro 3.

Sure it gets some fingerprints, but I don't mind that too much. I love using the surface laptop for almost anything, except for reading, I use my surface pro 4 for that purpose.

I received my laptop 3 days ago and I gotta say, it does feel very premium and performs great. The thing i truly wanted with this one was a good keyboard (i'm coming from Surface Pro 2017 and honestly typing on the type cover wasn't the best typing experience for me, especially as i use MS Word daily for hours) Typing on the Keyboard feels great. I can confidently say that this is the best keyboard I have ever used.","positive":1},{"review":"  Daily usage on this, my home laptop. Microsoft did a great job.

So while I know this obviously is not the best computer in the world, I must say that for the price, the specs are rather impressive.

Powerful enough to do most of coding and compiling if needed. N4100 comes with Intel UHD Graphics 600, which *significantly* under performs other popular more recent variance like UHD 640, which comes with 'Surface Go'.

It does have this weird thing in tablet mode where if you squeeze the screen and keyboard together too tightly, it will put the computer into sleep mode, but that is my only complaint.

Its a neat idea. Lot of email exchanges with Elgato support and still waiting for a resolution. Very poor quality and support to match.","positive":0},{"review":"  Let me first and foremost say that I am not a streamer or video related professional. I use the Stream Deck to add dedicated keys for common productivity tasks as well as direct visual hotkeys for UI elements in my apps.All that said I still like the device enough to keep it.

I've been on Windows 7 for a long, long time and finally decided to update to 10 so I could run this deck.  I'll wait and see if they make a V2 of this thing and try it again. I'm a little shocked this is rated as high as it is.","positive":0},{"review":"  Sure you can have macros and keys setup to do certain things for you, like links, or opening programs, commands, web sites, or launching programs etc, but this does it so well, and in style....","positive":0},{"review":"  I wish this unit came with more built-in documentation, but it follows the modern era of having virtually no included documentation and directing you to download stuff, even the manuals.  But the most glowing problem with this unit is the developers choice of using certain Microsoft Visual C libraries that make the unit incompatible with anything other than Windows 10.  Now they say in the product description that this is for Win10, but as of this writing, there's many more computers running earlier, more stable, less bloated Windows versions that ElGato has currently refused to support.  They could make a lot of people happy by switching software driver engineers who can make a product that will work with earlier Windows versions.","positive":0},{"review":"  Extremely angry.

I wish I would've gotten it sooner. Regardless I have only had this for less than a week and have already had so many friends inquire about it - it is not just useful for streaming it is useful for pretty much anyone who uses their computer the majority of the day. $150 isn't cheap, but the product is worth it imo.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been hesitant on purchasing an Elgato Stream Deck for quite some time because I didn't think it'd be worth the money.  However the Stream Deck has changed the way I use my computer and saved me so much time.It's worth every penny spent and I urge you to do research to see if the Stream Deck could improve your workflow.This review is completely unbiased and the Stream Deck was purchased with my own money.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a review of the Elgato Stream Deck (USB 2.0)(Measures 118 x 84 x 21mm or 4. The way it is now, the cable may be too long or short for what you need and if you damage the cable in any fashion, the unit is pretty much shot unless you pay to get it rewired.As with all my reviews, I will update this review should this develop any issues with ongoing use.","positive":1},{"review":"  Let me first stat to say that I did not purchase Stream Deck for gaming purposes. I purchased this thing for my office.Overall, once you get over this hurdle of programming this little marvel, you will find it extremely useful for everyday work and even for play. I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0The Elgato Stream Deck is a MUST for Content Creators, not just for streamers because there so much that you can do. You are able to open applications, set multimedia buttons, have shortcuts for applications, and of course their stuff for streaming. You are able to mute unmute your mic and or gameplay, tweet out when you are live, switch scenes, enables gifs, start stop streaming, etc, etc. I use this for when I'm streaming and using applications like Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Audition, basically whenever I'm editing and making a video (makes it a lot easier with the shortcuts).","positive":1},{"review":"  We had never used anything like this for our streaming and we were kind of leery of purchasing this because we didn't know what the heck we were doing.  At first, it was like trying to learn a foreign language...","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a pain in the posterior to do anything other than gaming, and for the application I most wanted to use it with, Adobe Lightroom, it`s virtually useless.  It can be adapted to work with Photoshop and most other Adobe applications, but it`s not simple to set up.  It`s currently a paperweight. Maybe some day I`ll have the time to figure out how to get something out of it, but I bought it to improve productivity, not force me to master another arcane device or memorize more strings of random numbers that are shortcuts , that sort of task set  no longer interests me.","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE - January 24th 2020, Giving this 3 stars after the differnt models came out and also bewarw of having the screens on all the time. Turn it to have a sleep mode, trust me. But not all is perfect, let's face it nothing is, but it's a small little gripe of mine and it's the stand, that little thing is a little flimsy for my liking but does work and isn't super thin. So go look up people's reviews on videos and I bet this is your next buy and so worth it.","positive":0},{"review":"  hooked it up and it looked great set up my first icon.. hit one button and 3 activate, but does nothing on my computer. total waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought this thing was going to solve all my problems, but it only introduced new ones. Not only is it tedious to set up, but some of your buttons will refuse to work or break during a live-stream. FYI, I use Steamlabs OBS (SLOBS) and I also have a new computer for streams only. Maybe it's just me as I do have a tendency to find bugs easily, but this thing is not worth the stress.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this to pair with an atem mini after reading some reviews about it o line being able to become a switcher of sorts.

The buttons are very customizable and the software is intuitive and easy to use. I don`t regret it since I bought it on sale. But at full price, it may be a bit much.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was easy to set up and I was very satisfied with it, but it stopped working day 2. The screen flickers white once every 15 seconds or so and it's no longer recognized by the software so I'm assuming it died. I think this is unacceptable for a $150 item.I contacted customer support about this issue but I have not heard back from them so far and I doubt they'll have a better fix than a replacement, so I will probably return this and get myself something less error-prone instead.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got a defective unit, bottom right corner button gets stuck (as if to be pressed without letting go, so instead of \"b\" I get \"bbbbbbbbbb\" this because a serious issue pending what hotkey I assign to it.

Hopefully my replacement will not have these issues and I will amend my  review and improve the rating.","positive":0},{"review":"  The ElGato Stream deck is great, has revolutionized my streaming workflow. I am already planning on getting a larger sized one for ease of use, but this one does everything I need it to do, although with more button pushes. But it works so I did not return it. But I don't think I will buy from this seller again.","positive":0},{"review":"  So a lot of people ask, why should I pay 150 bucks for what is essentially a macros keypad. The answer is the software.Additionally, the model that I didn't work. Corsair was quick to respond and sent me a replacement quickly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a programmer, and my editors have many actions that can be triggered using key combinations. However, there are many that I use infrequently or that have complex combinations I struggle to remember. I love that I can have multiple profiles, which allows me to set up banks of buttons for different uses.Worth every penny.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm normally to lazy to write Amazon reviews, but I'm so impressed with this thing I felt obliged..  But this is a teeny complaint.  I can't recommend this thing enough.","positive":1},{"review":"  While the Stream Deck is marketed towards people who want to control their livestreams (a task at succeeds at perfectly - one software install and nothing else was all it took to get it talking to OBS), it also works for damn near anything else thanks to its ability to do hotkeys.You want a mic spam soundboard for annoying your enemies. You'll figure something out in no time.Highly, highly recommended as an all-purpose tool for most computer users.","positive":1},{"review":"  Like many others who've purchased this before me, I think this is the best thing for streamers since the capture card.  It has so many functions and things that it can do, it blew me away.  So don't listen to the naysayers who are ignorant, buy a USB 3.0 port that HAS EXTERNAL POWER feeding it, and you'll not need to worry about the short cord.","positive":1},{"review":"  I do a lot of editing in FinalCut Pro X. I'm really bad at remembering shortcut keys. The ability to create and assign your own icons is very cool allowing the visual cue to be exactly what triggers my mental response to \"I need to make it go forward.\" Worth looking into if you do any repetitive tasks on your computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I don't use this for gaming. I use mostly in AV programs like Final Cut Pro (video editor) and Digital Performer (digital audio workstation). in my audio sequencer. I use it with a Mac, but it must work just as well with a PC.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you use Davinci Resolve this is a must. I couldn`t imagine using it without this. There is a lot more you can do with this than meets the eye. This isn`t just for gamers and I would say if you color grade, video edit, photo edit, etc - this is something that`ll speed up your workflow and make your life easier.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am not a Blogger or Pro Gamer - so this is just something I bought for fun.  With this, you can have 15 buttons to immediately launch programs or actions.  Great quality product, love how the logos pop up on the buttons - I wish my keyboard was like this (but with mechanical keys of course).  The images are nice and bright, easy to see in the day time, and as a gadget guy I give it 100%, two thumbs up, or whatever - it is great.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is perfect.  My only gripe is I wish I could afford the bigger one LOL.  Well built, the stand is great too.  Looking forward to years of using it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Since the very first day, buttons did not work 100%, and annoyed the hell out of me.  One day, buttons didn't work repeatedly, on air, I pulled everything apart, and throw it into garbage...","positive":0},{"review":"  My response to Elgato about their product which I am so thankful I bought through Amazon who refunded my money making an exception based on my documented email run around with Elgato 's direct support.The product worked for 2 weeks very well and then for 6 weeks nothing but a waste of my time. then implying that I had left out a key component of a screen shot that the support staff said \" didn't have OBS loaded\" which I clearly identified in as  screen shot, my rating on Amazon where I bought the Stream Deck will not be good. Very disappointed in your product, slow and inept support of your product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Stream deck is a bunch of keys and you define what they do to make your life easy and streaming a breeze. The problem is, it is constantly asking me to sign in and ruining my stream instead. They should not be asking anyone to sign in or even be online unless they are streaming to a service. In that case, you just need the sign in for the streaming service.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have maybe only used this product but a week since buying it this last Black Friday Sale Time before it failed and showed only white icons.  This thing is really great otherwise and has a ton of feature that help with streaming. While I am happy they are going to replace it I just feel they know that they are potentially selling a faulty produce with a certain model group of this product. Great product and great service but super annoying that I need to go through this.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this device for one reason - to have folder shortcuts. Silly. I tried renaming, looking up tutorials online, closing and restarting the program pretty much everything. Good product but some poor software functionality.","positive":0},{"review":"  At first this thing was a godsend. However, lately it freezes at some point each and every time we stream, leaving the buttons unresponsive and useless.and this is all happening on a brand new computer with a brand new install of Windows 10 with an obscene amount of RAM. There's no excuse for this.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love the product. Works well for what it is. Until then I will nest items in folders, hidden from easy access. Yay.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this for streaming. Makes things way more efficient. Problem is that I'm constantly putting in my settings because the stream deck glitches out. It takes me 20 to 30 minutes before starting my stream almost everytime to get my buttons back to doing what they're supposed to instead of giving me an error symbol.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a very neat concept but i can't do any special overlay or anything when steaming straight to YouTube. in order to do any of the fun stuff, it shows I have to stream to OBS then download my stream and upload it to my youtube channel making a lot more steps and taking more time.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an almost great product.  The software is super well designed and easy to use.  They take quite a bit of force to successfully engage (compared to my Logitech keyboard) and I often find myself having to push more than once to get the action.  If I used it a lot I'd expect my fingers to get tired.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you are just starting out streaming, this is not for you. There are many free options out there for digital stream decks (check out UpDeck). I went through so much just to get it to control my playlists, play, pause, and volume, but after an hour I got it to work, and for the most part, it's flawless now. I would love the option for changeable angle adjustment, as I have my Stream Deck a little farther away from me so the text gets warped from the contoured buttons.","positive":1},{"review":"  Even with two monitors, when you're playing a game, interacting with chat, and running a half dozen applications, having to tab around to take care of a task is inconvenient and distracting. It's particularly useful with urgent tasks (purging chat, muting your audio microphone).It's a costly product, when you compare it to a gaming keyboard or mouse, or other peripheral devices, but the sheer amount of customization, and that it allows you to display custom icons, it quickly becomes one of the most valuable input devices on your desk during a stream. I'm glad I bought it, the quality of life improvement has been tremendous.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this primarily to use while playing an online game where I can control several other characters. I created macros in the game and use this to trigger the macros. Elgato really nailed it with this device and it's a must have for so many uses. I can't wait to discover other uses for it in my daily gaming and application use.","positive":1},{"review":"  Easily one of the best investments you can make if you truly care about live streaming.One of the main problems I was having before getting this was using hotkeys in OBS. The streamlabs integration is also might useful, as you can now run credits or spin the wheel without needing the web interface openThe flexability and versatility of this thing is unmatched. Well worth the investment for streamers.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is versatile and extensive with just the built in features, throw in the knowledge of how to script in autohotkey or another program, and you get an infinitely more useful tool.I have tested this product for streaming, and it works amazing with the built in features to control OBS.Bottom LineThis gear is perfect for what is advertised for and is very simple to use in that regard.However if you have the itch to take it further and create more uses for it using scripting, your possibilities are endless with this piece of gear.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'll admit, I got this thing as a bit of a toy. My gaming keyboard has buttons on it I can map to macros to run xsplit scenes etc. It's surprisingly more useful and fun than I thought it would be. For the price I think it is an innovative little tool.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is fantastic for a power user. Don't be fooled by the market they push this device toward. Not a cheap plastic toy.If you're a nut about control and customization, don't think twice about this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  WOW.  A customize-able keypad with LCD screens to tell you what you programmed it to.  But it does have simple hotkey like 2 keys pressed together, and it separately has text input to replay, but cannot do both like sleep your PC by Windows+X, then U, then S.  But simple hot keys are good enough for me to love this device.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is great, hard to believe it's the price it is, in many ways it makes itself far more useful than more expensive equipment.  It is good for streaming, no doubt, and allows streamers (or just people recording videos) to do things like camera cuts, transitions, whatever, very easily and naturally, without having someone else running the board for you, which lets face it, 99% of streamers can't afford that sort of overhead to hire board ops, and friends only show when they're able.  If people have issues it is more than likely their computer.  I wish I was as happy with every purchase and found it as useful as I did this.","positive":1},{"review":"  STREAM DECK is  a command center for a computer. Its the best new computer interface since the mouse and touch screen, I say.  Can you do that eventually. Sure you can, just not tomorrow.","positive":1},{"review":"  Alright, 2 stars says \"i dont like it\" and 1 star says \"i hate it\". So here is my semi official review. Great concept but definitely wait longer on this one. Hope this helps you guys and pardon any of my spelling errors.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked fine for about 6 months. Just did a MacOS upgrade and it no longer works with My Elgato lights. Software is always the bane of these sorts of hardware products, and this one is no exception.","positive":0},{"review":"  Mine appears to have a line of dead white pixels running through the bottom row. I can't seem to get rid of it and there's no fix for this problem on the internet. But I agree with them that this does speak for the quality in the long run. Gonna return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The seller sent me a defective device that was broken upon arrival. I does not connect to my computer and doesn't work. Elgato support helped me figure out it was defective. Just a giant waste of my money and time.","positive":0},{"review":"  Useless garbage. Doesn't even say anything about Instagram.","positive":0},{"review":"  After installing the program I there were a few streaming and gaming apps preset.  The only Mac OSX app it has is Mail.  And the only thing the Mail switch does is open it.  I havn't even tried this in Windows, but it better be more versatile than on Mac, unless all these reviews are fake.","positive":0},{"review":"  Edit: Glitchy mess. Works somewhat, but the last few updates have broke all sorts of things I use on an almost daily basis. Not impressed anymore.This hardware is great, not just for streaming, but there are other uses you can use it for, including editing images in Photoshop (shortcuts to commonly used actions, etc), video editing, and more.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like the Elgato Stream Deck.  It's a pretty nifty tool which has helped out my stream a lot.  All SW and firmware is up to date.  So, besides that annoyance, this is a helpful device.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got a replacement since the top left button bugs out, and I certainly don't want to pay $150 dollars for something that's defective. Well the replacement has the same issue which is kinda garbage since it's pricey. At this point it's mostly the software that makes up for the board being a little defective. I would suggest waiting for this to go on sale.","positive":0},{"review":"  Cool product but I have not been able to get the F keys to work with the software. Downloaded the latest version and even called customer support which by the way was very good. Will return the product this week if I can't get it to work. Everything else works as stated.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my husband as a father's day gift, he is a content creator on several platforms and he LOVES this thing and so does his viewers fans. He uses it for different transitions for his streaming, to make fun noises for the fans, to use the voice changer thing, and all kinds of other things I honestly know very little about. It has held up really well the buttons are still shiny and look good even with lots of daily use. The packaging was nice, and we haven't had to call tech support.","positive":1},{"review":"  I hadn't heard of the Stream Deck until it appeared on Amazon as another \"Others have viewed\" item. After checking out the product page and then obsessively watching YouTube videos about it, I decided to take the plunge and buy one. When I checked their assigned actions in the software they had all somehow reverted to the same scene. It`s easy to fix but inconvenient, and it`s not clear why they suddenly changed their assigned actions.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this at a very good price here on Amazon. The reviews I saw on this were early versions of the software you use with it, and apparently, there WAS a point where you could only use folders on the first screen. It's a great device and if you don't want to drop the full amount on the full stream deck, it's definitely worth it. I probably will eventually upgrade to a full size stream deck, but for the size and sophistication of my stream, this fits me just fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for a solution to control my music (through winamp, still the best music playing software.) where i didnt have to switch back and forth between games and winamp, and i didnt want a giant keyboard with all the extra media keys so this thing does what i need perfectly.  a great little device that does a ton things and does it well.  i highly recommend this to anybody who needs some extra customization but doesnt want a giant, usually tacky looking keyboard.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to use with Star Citizen.  It's a perfect MUD for all your games, but with Star Citizens complexity, the Stream Deck really makes it easier.I don't use it for streaming, so I can't speak to it's uses there but I can imagine with Stream Deck's ease of use and ability to customize and map virtually any command you can think of, It would be extremely useful for any command heavy software.  It's a bit expensive, even more so for a gaming device, but then, I buy digital spaceships, so there's no accounting for good judgment here.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is one of the best pieces of electronics that I have ever purchased and I totally recommend it. I am a Twitch Streamer and a Graphic designer, so I have been wanting to purchase a stream deck for the longest time and I am so glad that I went with this size and this specific stream deck. If you are streamer, a designer, a video editor, I highly recommend this product. It made my life so much easier.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm using this for streaming on Twitch, and I am just in love with this little device. It makes it so much easier to trigger all kinds of things, from sound effects, to visual effects, to scene changes. I found it very useful, and my only regret was not buying the one with more keys. For this one, you can have multiple \"profiles\" so you're not limited to the number of keys, though.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this because I like to live stream games sometimes, and I only have one PC with one monitor, so something like this is very convenient for someone like me. I always hate having to alt+tab out of games to bring up another window or program, so this works perfectly for me. I highly recommend one of these to anyone who likes to live stream games, or just plays them and hates alt+tabbing all the time. .","positive":1},{"review":"  When I first purchased this, wasnt sure how well it would work out.  For those that are building their own smarthome, this is one piece of gear you should look at.  I am creating a series of videos on my social media channels that show how easy it is to do.  May end up having to purchase the  full size stream deck after all.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this thing. I use it to edit feature films with Media Composer on a Mac. Way better than the stream deck software. I hope this helps.","positive":1},{"review":"  Small screensGood if they are doing a live broadcastFrom one deviceIf you are streaming from two devicesThey are not usefulGood product howeverPrice versus performancevery expensiveI think the price of 60 - 75 dollars is goodAdvice:Look for reviews before buying and make sure you need them.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is great and most people that buy it will be pleased. My only complaint is that they put a shipping label on the front of the product box without cellophane wrap. Hopefully I will be able to use isopropyl alcohol to remove the sticker without damaging the images on the box.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked ok, but had to return it.lights start flashing after a while which is not only distracting but you cant use the device while you are trying to time a button press to a light flash event.The tilt stand doesnt let it sit in a position that is high enough to remove light from reflecting off the reflective keys, so instead of being intuitive and easy to read, you ahve to align yourself in front of the pad to see which buttons you are pressing, thus eliminate any time saved by doing things manually as i used to.","positive":0},{"review":"  The unit I got was used from the Amazon warehouse. From some reason would not connect thru the USB port. It probably was defective.

Even the blue is a little off.Will exchange and uodate review if appropriate.","positive":0},{"review":"  About 2-3 months in unit would randomly go blank, no display on the keys and keypresses no longer working.  Eventually it stopped working completely and now when plugged in shows \"USB power surge Detected\" on my PC.  It's great when it works, but this is not the longevity I was hoping to see in a 150$ unit.","positive":0},{"review":"  I plan on updating this review very soon. *****Currently in RMA process*****Let me start off by saying, I'm loving the idea of this. (Poor guy was one the phone with me for over an hour trying to help me) Once we determined that it wasn't an issue on my end (restarts, reinstalls, trying different software versions, general troubleshooting), they sent me a shipping label, and I received an email confirmation that it was received by them. Currently, I'm just waiting on a fed-ex confirmation that the new one has been sent.","positive":0},{"review":"  95% of the content in your streamdeck will be held inside of folders, which means one of the six keys will be dedicated to a back button and at least one will be dedicated to a deeper folder.  This severely limits your workflow efficiency and organization.  Save up to shell out a little bit extra for the 15-key, as the software and support are fantastic and you absolutely deserve the quality available to you through the 15-key.","positive":0},{"review":"  This item broke after 5 months. It stopped allowing me to add items.","positive":0},{"review":"  So i was really looking forward to this item. good reviews. TL:DR --- Unless your a windows 10 user. Find another product.","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE: The issues I had with the Stream Deck appears to be due to powering the device from a weak USB Hub. I recommend always plugging this deck into a dedicated USB on your computer. Once I did that my issues have been resolved so far.So with that I highly recommend it as a time saver and values upgrade to any video stream and podcast platform.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little product is amazing. I won't go on about it because most everyone looking at it already knows what it does. We would love for Corsair to be Linux-friendly. Star docked for this reason, as well as several buggy quirks that seemed to take a while to work out over my last few weeks on Windows.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love using this even if you aren't a streamer. I spend half of every day on video calls and using this with macros has helped speed up my process each day. I use it to turn on lights, mute the mic, turn on the camera, open zoom app, adjust volume, lock my computer screen, share my screen,  allow participants on zoom, end a meeting, join next meeting, open slack, pause notifications (important while presenting), and so many more things, it's crazy awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  Buying these were a bit of a geeky indulgence rather than a necessity, but I do adore them. I have two of the XLs and one of the original 15 button versions.) I particularly like the new stand on the XL (the 15 button version was a bit flimsy) and it's great that they have changed the design to a detachable USB type C connector. The price is a bit of a killer, so whilst I could certainly live without it - it is a lovely device to have (if you can afford it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had it for a month or so now, completely customized to my needs. I literally open my Twitch Dashboard, Chatty, & Stream Labels from the home menu, have a sub menu for my scenes, & control all my going live tweets, & fellow streamer shout outs (both in chat & on Twitter) from it. If you're thinking about getting one, whetehr you're just starting or have been streaming for 5 years like myself, just do it. You will NOT regret it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this device because I had the ambition to make videos and eventually stream on Twitch. I've got to say, I had NO IDEA how useful this thing is. :)Overall, I recommend this product. It will allow you to be much more creative.","positive":1},{"review":"  I knew this would help with streaming when I only had 1 monitor but I got a second monitor just before this and this still makes streaming leaps and bounds better. I've tried a lot of different cheap or free alternatives involving iPads or other small keyboards but the big thing these things lack is really nice software to go with it.I would love to see a more native and versatile icon creator. The current online version isn't all that great right now but you can use any image editor to make icons too if you want to take that extra time.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you have seen this and wanted it, then buy it. What an awesome product. I can go on and on. Follow me on twitch CreamofMars and ask me to show you how a novice like me switches scenes, mutes mics, tweets, and even change my voice with the simple push of a button.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this more for macros than streaming (even though I do stream occasionally). After seeing some people use this as a macro keyboard I decided to pick one up and have to say It works great. This basically made me have a key used for a folder for any profile i want to use. Lowering the max from 15 to 14 on any profile.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm not using this device for any of the \"Live Content Creation\" capabilities. Using it to store program, file, folder and website shortcuts.For anyone planning to use it heavily for hotkey programming, note that the software presently does not recognize the difference between left and right modifier keys (Shift, Control or Alternate), although their tech support told me that they may consider it for future firmware updates.A great piece of hardware.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the stream deck, but I travel a fair amount and the connected USB cable should have been designed separately (which I think they have done with new models), as it is hard to pack efficiently and it will most likely break off.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ifyou are not tech savy do not buy this also the instruct book letters are to small to read returning product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works for the most part, except the top right button sticks.

Didn't have to read the manual at all.Also, if you have Stream Deck software running, the button state does not synch with the state of the stream deck. Another bug that needs to get fixed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works well, but pretty disappointed it showed up clearly being used before. A few marks on the unit itself and the box it came in was all ripped up.","positive":0},{"review":"  While the functions are nice and customization, it's a rather overpriced tool.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this after watching a video that El Gato had posted to their YT channel. The thing that got me was at the end the PR Rep had said \"There is so much you can do with this, it's just how the user uses it. It's small and barely takes up any room on my desk. It's one of the best things I have bought.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is great. I love the little screens, i love the customization available, and I love the usefulness. It would be most awesome if it was part of the stream deck software and you could just add it there.But overall this is the best accessory I have purchased for my PC.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is designed for streaming, but that's not what I use it for.I work at a computer and need a handful of applications open all the time.I've also told it to play pause skip  music and volume, so I can control all of that with my left hand instead of fumbling around on the keyboard. Great stuff.","positive":1},{"review":"  The hardware feels well built and looks cool. The screens are so far below the tops of the keys, that there is a bit of a viewing angle problem unless you view the device straight on.The Hotkey Switch is sadly limited to hotkeys only, so not great for turning on and off Wifi or Bluetooth, etc.Add in the ability to utilize command line arguments (powershell or dos commands) and open up the switch function to allow for more than just hotkeys and it will be a lot more flexible.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am at my computer much of the time and I wondered if I would really opt to use this or not.Well the answer is I do use it. Multiply that like 50+ times a day and that alone is a time saver not to mention the other great uses it has.A hugely useful buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Added this into my workflow, and it has made a huge quality of life improvementI have set up profiles for Lightroom, Premier, and Photoshop, and mapped my most used shortcuts to it.I won't be removing this from my setup anytime soon.I also made a profile for Elite Dangerous, and it is wonderful. There's a very very slight delay so i can't see it being used for competitive games, but in games like E:D where you just need to hit a key to open the scoop or lower landing gear, and it isnt going to kill you to have half a second delay, then this is for you too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I pre-orderd the Elgato Stream Deck for use in our Play 4 PawZ charity stream on May 26, 2017. I was a bit worried it may not get here in time if there was a shortage in supply but Elgato was ready for the demand and Amazon got it here within 2 days.

Four out of Five Stars for sure.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Stream Deck is a good product with a lot of uses but it's lack of a removable USB cable represents such a substantial single point of failure that it earns this hardware 1 star.

Ive done research and noticed this has been going on for about 4 years now to a couple customers. If anyone has the solution please let me know.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you're wanting to use this within a DAW (digital audio workstation) used for music mixing, it doesn't work. The hotkey commands only worked when I was in windows but not when I was within a DAW program. Will need to try something else. That said, the build was great and it did work very well on the windows 10 platform, but just not within my DAW.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was doing what I wanted it to do for my streams and gaming but then the lights were going off on certain ones. Or I not work in general unless I plugged it out and in.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0I love the idea and the software is okay,BUT:The keys frequently double tap, making double the sounds or toggle on goes right back to toggle off.  It's infuriating to use this device to hande your stream, but not be able to trust the buttons wont double tap.  I REALLY REALLY wanted to 100% love this but that hardware issue alone is worth a SOLID warning to others.The other small issue is the short USB cord, but I have USB extension cables so that's not as bad, just make sure you have one if your PC isn't directly near you.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product great after learning to information through others.","positive":0},{"review":"  Possibly the worst named and marketed device yet.  This visual programmable keyboard is very, very cool. Multiple profiles are supported so creating a custom profile for each application is a natural idea.  You can assign a key to be a folder which then allows you to create a sub folder of more key mappings (if you like this approach).","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is amazing. I don't use it for gaming or streaming.But honestly, if you use a computer on a regular basis, and usually use the same programs, I promise this can and will improve your workflow. Having a custom button with image for whatever you want is just so powerful.","positive":1},{"review":"  Significantly better than I expected it to be. Having this Stream Deck is such a quality of life improvement when it comes to streaming.

(I use it for switching video inputs during live multi-camera broadcasting with OBS Studio. I wish instead of a permanently-attached USB cable it was a detachable USB cable. That's the only ding against this otherwise superb device.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've used keyboard macros, HID macros, 3rd party keypads like the Nostromo and etc and never really had a great experience with them. This worked immediately, is very intuitive to setup, and makes even multi-action tasks easy to setup and assign to a hotkey. With Adobe Photoshop CC, I can easily assign all the hotkeys that I use in a single folder whereas with the 15-key I'd have had to do some folder nesting. It all comes down to use-case, but I definitely recommend this to anyone who streams or games and uses their computer for other tasks at the same time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this unit to do live streaming with OBS, as clicking the OBS checkboxes has left me with no audio and other problems.I had problems with the unit doing what I wanted it to do, and after contacting their customer support, I found I was doing things incorrectly.Although I only got this to work with OBS, I found the addition of launching apps I use such as Premiere Pro for video editing to be fantastic, as well as opening folders I frequently use.Very happy with the purchase and the customer support, so I recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can't believe it took me this long to find this product.  I cannot live without it.  Recently I setup macros to access the Windows Desktop features, did you know Windows 10 had multiple desktops built into it.

I had zero trouble connecting it and software interface is a pice of cake..  Mine is more like 4'9\" so I don't know if that is an earlier version or the person can't measure :).","positive":1},{"review":"  I have nothing negative to say about this thing, at least, once the software installed (version at the time kept failing, had to install an earlier version then upgrade). It was worth that little bit of hassle though. Honestly cannot recommend it enough and plan to upgrade to the XL  model when I can, but I'm poor and they are NOT cheap. If pressed for a bad point, the stand for the 16 button model could be better I suppose.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0I have longed for a truly programmable button pad or keyboard for a very long time, but they've always been way too far out of my price range. I've only been playing with the Stream Deck for a short bit and already have fallen in love with it. I plan to go through apps like AE, PS, and Maya to set up some workflow shortcuts. In fact, I'm done reviewing and off to do that now.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product has literally changed the my workflow on my computer. I spent the first couple of days setting up customer profiles for a bunch of software that I use regularly and now I cannot live without it. I can definitely recommend this product with my full backing and although having the XL version is amazing, you can definitely still do some incredible things with the smaller ones. But overall amazing product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a live sound engineer for a live sound company that caters to corporate events, and I occasionally have clients that would like walk up songs, presenter bios, or have a pre-recorded Voice of God (VOG) stingers. The Stream Deck makes it easy to drag and drop audio file to whatever button you like and you can customize the icon. The only way I could imagine improving this would be to have the USB cable detachable incase the cable goes bad, you could replace it. However if you carry it around in a case like I do, or use it for gaming streaming in which it will stay in the same spot, this shouldn't be a problem.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m not a streamer or a gamer. I bought this to use it as a shortcut device to open applications and load up websites, which does work that way. You can also use nested folders which is really useful.I strongly recommend this to everyone.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I've read numerous reviews on this device prior to purchase, and my son (the techie) bought one first. He explained it in detail and told me his uses for it. I will add that you might want to have a plan. I re-mapped my keypad multiple times while trying to make up my mind.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love having macros set up for anything I can have one for, but having a 10 keyless keyboard means that the number of keys I have to put macros on without interfering with games and programs is very few. The Strem Deck has been an answer to my prayers.Cannot recommend this product enough. My only gripe is a personal one as I cannot decide on a final setup, and am always changing things around on it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Many say that you don't need this many buttons, but I've easily filled 4 folders full with options for quick text, application shortcuts, media controls, and recording audio software tricks. You can use this device as a MIDI controller including running midi macros and multi-actions.  Before I purchased this, I was using HID Macros to run macro shortcuts on my system and this is easily a magnitude larger quality of life improvement over that. It works well and is no-to-low fuss.","positive":1},{"review":"  the software does not support Windows 7 for some reason.","positive":0},{"review":"  It has very bad image retention.

The reason why it lost 2 stars is because of the bothersome 'ripple' effect on the LCD screen. I seriously question the durability of the item in that regard.","positive":0},{"review":"  There seems to be a strange problem with the display -- within minutes of plugging it in, the screen would flicker.  After about half an hour of this, it stopped flickering but seems to now have a washed out effect over the display.  I'm now on business day 4 of waiting for a reply (website says 1-3 days).  Sorry, Elgato, it looked nice, but it'll look nicer with the money I wasted on it back in my pocket.","positive":0},{"review":"  After even getting a replacements, this device does not work as advertised. The software that this app uses crashes constantly and does not allow any customization of the buttons without something breaking. For example the Logitech G13 Game Pad (works perfect for hotkeys and streaming. It's cheaper, and has more buttons too).","positive":0},{"review":"  Very great concept but the build quality feels cheap relative to the hefty price tag. Buttons dont press down evenly and the cord is not detachable if I ever needed to replace it.The software is great, however.","positive":0},{"review":"  Has a lot of potential once the software behind it catches up.","positive":0},{"review":"  3 stars because it doesn`t support my favorite OS which is Windows 7.

I don't think you'll regret it.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I absolutely love this thing. It makes EVERYTHING easier - from my 3d modeling keystrokes, shortcuts, launchingPrograms and just being awesome to look at and customize, I just have a few quick quips which stop the perfect 5 star review:1: I can't do quick strings of text, only shortcuts.But for now, in my first week, it's amazing.

I was blown away by the little thing.. I recommend it to anyone that needs a great way to implement their hotkeys.","positive":1},{"review":"  I used it on a gig I had and this thing is awesome. I own the 15 button stream deck and love it, but this one seriously saved me so much time not having to change pages. I use this with Bitfocus Companion. The only thing I wish it had is a usb c to usb c cable for the price it should of brought two cables, it ships with a usb to usb c cable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have programmed in profiles for all of my apps and I have it working with Keyboard Maestro on a Mac.  I use it to control OBS when I am recording or video conferencing and it is amazing.  I suppose you've got to view this as a product where you are going to have to invest a lot of time to customize everything, but if you are looking for something that can be made all yours this is amazing.  It has changed how I use my computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Wow, Elgato, just, Wow.This little thing is a bit pricey - but this is already worth every single penny.  I use them to instantly do what I want, but they can as advertised be used with delays.  Good Job Elgato, please, keep making more updates.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love everything about this thing, HIGHLY customizable and good for so very many applications. With a few new plugins this thing would be amazing. The list goes on and on. If you can write your own plugins the uses can be almost limitless.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this thing, but the setup is a BIT DAUNTING.. With that said. It is a great tool to have when using OBS to switch in between scenes, mute mics, and command other different operation.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is awesome. Even if I'm not streaming, I use it's soundboard integration to have fun with my friends in discord. All of your streaming and recording controls are right there in front of you with their own dedicated buttons. It's so nice.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is exactly what you need for a quicky getting a steam together. While it does exactly what is advertised it doesn't do as much of what is advertised. While it uses Twitch, Twitter, and OBS its options are few, not to mention nothing for YouTube. I would wait till some upgrades or the price lowers as this is an expensive toy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great tool my only gripe is its not as cusomizable as it should be and they really dropped the ball with no windows 7 support.","positive":0},{"review":"  Originally loved the idea but not for gaming. I wanted to use this with Win10, Pixel phone, and Tasker. Keyboard shortcuts don't register (using EventGhost to monitor), and the open website in background fails to do anything.

I returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received an empty carton.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just got the stream deck a few days ago and set it up. Found out right away that the software to set it up started having issues integrating with Tipee stream. I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PRODUCT. But if Elgato doesn't get back to me and help me fix this, I'm sending it back right away and won't be purchasing any products from them in the future.","positive":0},{"review":"  It seems like a good product but it definitely isn't worth the price.  I set it up for my stream today and spent at least three hours setting it up how I like it but I had to press the buttons multiple times for it to work. I tried on my PC a Razer Blade and ASUS ROG laptop. I can stream perfectly fine with OBS on all three but once I attached the stream deck, added my profile for media sources then hotkey it was delayed quite a bit.","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros :- Looks nice- Mostly simpler than setting up traditional hotkeys- Software is fairly intuitiveCons :- Noticeable delay or complete lack of response from button presses, even testing at less than 10% cpu loads- Extremely short 3ft USB cable severely limits where it can be used without an extender- Buttons feel like a bad, worn out laptop keyboard- Severely limited functionality unless integrated with other Elgato equipment.I'm not hugely surprised, I don't think anyone buys this without a specific goal in mind and expects it to be lifechanging, but I was still pretty underwhelmed by just how little this can actually do without even more equipment.I suspect the price tag is essentially to subsidize the hundreds of \"review\" units that went out early and, unsurprisingly, got glowingly positive reviews from the people using it for free. Strictly speaking it mostly functions, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a video editor and use this in combination with Keyboard Maestro to run macros on repeatable sequences. Having these buttons with changeable labels is incredible. I often push the button with nothing happening. Make the clickability better and this thing would be unbeatable.","positive":0},{"review":"  I find the deck extremely useful for video games, video editing and for anything I need to use repetitive things for (like writing the same text or opening the same programs).I only have 2 problems1: Its kinda glitchy (the multi-function key presses does not work, for example). But yeah. If you can live with a faulty product, it is still very helpful to have.","positive":0},{"review":"  This thug makes my life so much easier. I do everything from product presentations to leading on-line church on Zoom and otherMeeting software. I had to figure it out on my own.  Painful, but once done, it performs admirably.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very easy and straight forward product. My only gripe is that with all the different things you can do with the software, it does not have a function to turn off your computer when pressed. Other than that, with the endless folder options, I'm able to have all my games loaded and just cycle endlessly. Definitely a good pick up for gamers or even people who need additional macros.","positive":1},{"review":"  I connected the Stream Deck to my monitor. And the monitor alternates between connecting to a Windows PC and a MacBook. Oh wow. Can`t wait to try that.","positive":1},{"review":"  I stream games. This product is endlessly configurable with the Elgato software. However, the plastic housing feels cheap, and the stand is definitely not great. With a few improvements to the material this could easily be my favorite peripheral of all time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've loved creating custom programs and functions for my stream deck. Some lights don't work natively, so it's been interesting finding ways around it. But for live things like using a stream deck with WAVES, or Blackmagic ATEM software. I recommend the XL because you aren't going through folders to change inputs.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased the El Gato Stream Deck to use for gaming and video editing and it is freakin awesome. I love this thing.  For the stream deck was a game changer and would definitely recommend it to a friend or anyone. Really cool.","positive":1},{"review":"  The quality of the stream deck it`s self is great. My only complaint is that sometimes when you hit a button the screen in it looks like you jammed your finger into it. It`s not awful but I`m not a fan. Overall it is definitely worth the money, especially when you learn the software and get creative.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best purchase I have made in a while. This is so useful, even more so than I knew when I purchased. Talk about versatile use.I can not say enough on how useful this Stream Deck is, this thing is pure AWESOME.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far I am very pleased with the Elgato Stream Deck.  I just created three reviews on it so far on my channel \"Legacy Studio Reviews\".Over-all this thing is GREAT, and very user friendly.  I honestly think the value is excellent and really helps get your stream to that professional level because it simplifies EVERYTHING.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm not a gamer or much of a YouTuber, but I love this.  It's the ultimate bonus extra toy for anybody with a serious home office or desk set-up.The buttons are completely customizable and I use them for (lazily) speeding up workflow, controlling Hue lights, turning on lights and cameras (for videoconference) and other neat things.It's easy to use and a brilliant gadget.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this as a gift for my brother since he likes to stream his games on twitch and what not. I figured this would make it better for him but when he installed it, it kept crashing his computer and giving him the blue screen of death. He took it off and boxed it back up. So sad, i was hoping it would have been a good gift.","positive":0},{"review":"  Hard wired USB cable that is very short. Only works on Windows 10, no support for Win 7.

So now ive got a $150 brick with some clicky buttons.","positive":0},{"review":"  Mine hasn't worked from the moment it came out of the box. OBS scenes require you to hold the button to hold on to the scene. On May 29, they said they couldn't duplicate it.  I'm going to try uninstalling and reinstalling one more time, but mine has been a total waste of time.","positive":0},{"review":"  I get a lot of use out of this device and I would LOVE to recommend this product BUT for $150 dollars is too much money for a device that requires a soldering iron to replace the USB cord. $150 also is too much money for a macro keyboard with LCD screens behind each button. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice device that is very useful, but its functions could easily be emulated using freeware macro software. I only have one because mine was a gift from my sister.","positive":0},{"review":"  There are 15 programable keys on your 10-key... save your money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Seems cool, can't us it.  I won't give it a lower or higher review until or if I update to win 10.for which this was purchased.

Waste of a lot of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have used a few programmable keyboards over the years, as well as creating system macros, etc..I no longer have to 'memorize' what key I assigned, or print out tiny stickers to place on the keyboards.

Easily the coolest thing I've gotten for my set-up in a long time.","positive":1},{"review":"  This, combined with BarRaider's and other plugins give you a TON of functionality.Also now you can integrate with IFTTT to control your lights, music, and more.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is great. I love being able to program keyboard shortcuts into it, such as one to take a screenshot. They're a bit concave, so it warps and cuts off the edges of the icons. Other than that though, it's fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  My use case is a little different than everyone else.  I'm not streaming games.  The Stream Deck is great for setting up Audio mute   Video Mute and triggered Powerpoint presentations during my lectures.  I also use it to trigger bits of pre-recorded audio that I use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I decided to step up my game a bit and get a Stream Deck mini. I do some streaming twice a week on iRacing.

You can also use this in normal life to open programs and stuff too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I hate to share this secret, but this little gadget helped us make CoolToys.TV way cooler.  We added the stream deck and each episode she only pushes a button and we get inserts, camera changes and she can manage the audio between the black magic and the laptop we use to manage the stream.  It can do way more than this, but for what we use it for it is amazing.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have known about Stream Decks for several years, but only recently purchased one to experiment with. First up was creating a set of action buttons for running Zoom meetings, which has been great.

My team took note of the Stream Deck and went from 1 to 5 of them.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got the Stream Deck based on recommendation of Live Streaming Pros on YouTube and it plugged right into my iMac, shook hands with my ECAMM Live and makes the going live so much easier than having to remember all the hotkeys while engaging the audience via audio and video.

Highly recommend for streamers and gamers.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Elgato came in Clutch once again... Thank you so much for making an amazing stream that this helps out for so many things it`s not even just good for streaming I actually use it for editing videos as well you`re able to buying the keys however you want and change the pictures however you want so you can change them in Photoshop and make them look really nice and cute and then put them onto your stream deck.","positive":1},{"review":"  Literally plug and play-well after downloading the software-This hardware makes streaming so easy, changing scenes, enabling and disabling sources so easy,At first i was afraid i could not understand how to use it and i was going to end up watching 20 videos before i could use it,But i was wrong, this is just the easiest piece of hardware to use,I use it with OBS Studio.","positive":1},{"review":"  What Cant you use this for .Gamers use this for GTA, Video Editors use this for Splicing and Editing.Rasberry Pi and this controller for HAM Radio controls, THE SKY IS THE LIMIT.Prove Me wrong.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing literally changes the streaming world and how you do it. Works like a champ, if I had a complaint it would be that it be more integrated to things outside of OBS.

(I am a perfectionist-- you can be up and running with it in minutes).","positive":1},{"review":"  I don't use this for gaming or much media content creation. It's great for the media content creation that I do, but mostly I use it for Smart Home control (Hubitat) and for work.The nested folders allow me great control options for multiple different scenarios, and the ability to create my own key icons makes it very easy to find what I'm looking for, even if I decide to move stuff around a bit to add more functions.Really invaluable tool that saves me a ton of time at work.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just received my Stream Deck to find out they don't support Windows 7.

Not to the standards that I've become accustomed to from Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved how it looked and how slim it was, first day was great, next morning I turned it on it felt a bit slow the I thought it was my internet, the from 11 am till next morning, it stayed frozen with the curser as a blue round search motion, had to drain the whole battery so it turned off, then I put the charger back in, it was slow and glitching.Maybe I just got a bad one but I even sent a video to amazon demonstrating how it`s stuck  frozen.","positive":0},{"review":"  Get used to the spinning circle with this computer.  Some programs like excel and office run fine but others like yahoo mail essentially don`t function due to processing time outs. Very disappointed but I will hold on to it for Microsoft office functions only.  Might as well get some use out of this paperweight.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer is completely useless after using it for a month. The mouse and microphone have stopped working entirely. This was the biggest waste of money. I completely regret buying this, and I wish the seller or manufacturer would help make this right.","positive":0},{"review":"  We bought this laptop when my husband needed to start working from home and our kids needed to use our other laptop for school. When the laptop arrived it was stuck in setup and my husband (who used to work in IT years ago) was able to fix it. The computer has to stay plugged in if you want to complete a days work with it. Also, it is painfully SLOW.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this computer less than a week ago. The first day I set it up and it was fine the second day it started to freeze. Maybe I got a faulty one. Do you do swaps or refunds.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this lap top for the sole purpose of streaming on-line music through my stereo (via hookup to my DAC then to my stereo).  This just means bringing up a single web page (say youtube) and hitting the play button. Bringing up just microsoft edge alone takes 100% of its cpu and it is ridiculously slow in displaying web pages so that I can pick which music to stream.  I would not recommend it and would not have bought it if I knew how poor the performace is - almost to the point of being useless.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like slim size and the amout of storage it has but dislike the fact that it starts doing it's own thing mid typing.  Its like someone is pressing down on all the keys at the same time or as if someone has taken over the screen and doing what they want with it.  It's very annoying especially when your using it for a business.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an excellent product for the value. Note this product is not touch screen and it looks very similar to a MacBook Air. Just to a little to do the original updates when I took out of the box for the first time.

I would call it a netbook more than a full powered laptop. I have a gaming laptop and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to that in terms of speed, but what it has is a beautiful form factor similar to many ultrabooks and akin to Mac, priced very well, portable, good amount of RAM, solid state hard drive with expand-ability and a full HD screen.It also comes with a silicon keyboard protector which may be of use for those on the go.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop for use in my new home-based business.

I would much rather buy a refurbished business class dell laptop like this latitude laptop than one of the home model Inspiron models.

The Intel chip powering WiFi functions crashes periodically and you either need to reboot the machine (on Windows for example) or force a PCI rescan (thankfully it's easy on Linux) to get connectivity back.

Well, most of it's okay, but the hard drive started failing only a couple months after purchase. But I got a Latitude because of its durability, and now I have to treat it like it's fragile. I could have gone for a newer Inspiron for the same price and a better result, all because the refurbisher either did a bad job or started with a product they should have scrapped in the first place.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was fine, except it didn't come with windows 10 activated. It shouldn't have shipped without that being done. Last time I reviewed this, the company emailed me to tell me that is industry standard.

Off course two weeks after the 90 days the computer stops working, I call and although they answered they told me they can`t do anything so I need to take it to a local shop to fix it, and I`m not even sure they will be able to do anything, with the fix and everything I have to do now, it does not make sense to buy a refurbished product, especially from this supplier.","positive":0},{"review":"  The battery died in two months.

I've tested several and owned a few.UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money. I'll be returning this used model.","positive":0},{"review":"  At first, I loved this laptop. It was easy to set up. Now we are stuck with a laptop that doesn't work. There are risks to buying refurbished items.","positive":0},{"review":"  After not even 6 months of light to medium use my computer no longer works. The screen is all messed up. I would not reccomend.","positive":0},{"review":"  The charging port is broken.  Just like that, the chromebook doesn't charge at all.  This happened the third week of use, I'm happy I can still return.  Be wary of refurbished, it's basically saying that it is either broken or will break shortly.","positive":0},{"review":"  Our second Acer, loved the first for almost 3 years. This was its replacement, but has a high pitched whine when operating. Poor response, returned the defective device, in their possession for three days and no word from seller.

Beware.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop came in good condition (as expected because it was refurbished). But the charger was defective.

I've had this for several months now, and it is a great value.  A great value.  Enjoy.","positive":1},{"review":"  First time using chrome wanted windows 10 but haven't had to use my phone anymore and I no longer charge then since this helps me do everything I need at light speed. Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself. It's also light and it comes with this cool bubble wrapping packaging that I've been using in between my lap and the laptop and for storage . My fav thing about this is it's taken over my use or cravings to even use a mobile or smartphone iPhone which is only explained by how easy it is to get everything social media done on a Chromebook while I do plan to get a Dell that runs windows 10 this is really good to save ur other devices from the load social media and YouTube can out on a device built to run more complex programs.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this for a friend and now I'm jealous.  I love the Chrome platform and I would get one myself if I could get one equipped with a much larger hard drive.  Bigger screen, easy to see.  This is more or less a large tablet with a keyboard.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wanted to get a laptop for my stepdad because his was infected with so many different things that it didn't work properly anymore. So, when I saw this I couldn't believe my luck at the amazing price. I'm EXTREMELY happy with this purchase, and my stepdad was even happier. THANKS GUYS.","positive":1},{"review":"  As a student, im not exactly rolling in money but needed a laptop for school so a Chromebook was a given. This product shipped on time, had no visible scratches and the cheapest i have found and has had no problems in these first few weeks. The only thing thats not quite as good as i wanted (given the price isn't a big deal at all) is just the track pad is a bit finicky. all being said is a solid product and i wasn't even able to tell it was refurbished.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a good computer for what it is, and what it is is a Chromebook. That means it is a laptop running Google`s Chrome OS. I won`t get into that, just simply explain that it`s possible.For your money, it is a good machine and I actually enjoy using it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was in the market for a Chromebook to do my school work on as an educator and not break my pocketbook purchasing it. This one fit the bill. I have been using it daily, numerous times a day for over a month now. It is a great laptop for my educational classroom needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Chromebook is basically a glorified tablet in the shape of a lappy.  I don't mean that in a bad way...","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been curious about chromebooks since I've sent two kids off to college. I bought this one because the price was ideal for me to try it out. I think I'd have trouble with an 11 or 13 inch screen but this one seems fine. It is however, pretty washed out.","positive":1},{"review":"  It was a gift for senior citizens. They had it working in minutes from unboxing.Delivery was as advertised even when hurricanes raging last week.Much easier to start up than typical pc.","positive":1},{"review":"  Laptop is fair. It's slightly slow but is good enough speed if you use it to just surf the internet like I do. I could understand if they didn't but then they went out of their way to say I bought it 129 days ago and is far outside the warranty. That just isn't true and I don't feel this seller is honest or the laptop is built for long term use.","positive":0},{"review":"  WARNING: my package came without the charging cord. When I asked Amazon to issue a credit so that I could buy a cord on its own they would not offer any solution other than return and refund of the entire item.","positive":0},{"review":"  Start: 3 starI did the setup and had problems setting up my wifi. Everything else connects but this laptop wanted to fight about it. PLEASE don't waste your time. I can't enjoy my laptop or do anything on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing isn't terrible, and pretty good if you want something cheap for your kid to take to school. It appears to be pretty durable, though undoubtedly a bit large and heavy for lugging to school as well. it's way too sensitive and makes selections all over the place without me even touching anything. It was happening so much today, that I decided to write this review (after grabbing the mouse).","positive":0},{"review":"  For what I bought it for, it serves its purpose perfectly. I am very happy after using it for a week now. Bought a new charger and is back to good. So computer works great, the process was the bummer.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product would not come on. O for contact Acer and they sent me a new charger but the charger wasn't the problem it was the laptop. So Acer was very helpful and fair I just didn't stay within the time frame to send it back to get it fixed. But I did find a sure who says they could fix it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this in late October as a Christmas gift, so the box was not opened until late December.  The Chromebook worked fine for a couple of weeks and then wouldn't even turn on.  Bad merchant.  Don't take a risk with their refurbished units.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`ve had this laptop for a few months. It`s painfully slow compared to my husbands MacBook.I`ve used the thing maybe 20 times tops.Waste of my time and money.","positive":0},{"review":"  My first and probably last chromebook.1)  Computer arrived in pretty much brand new looking finished.  It would have been nice if the seller would have set the puter back to factory stats prior to mailing it.  1 hour of my life wasted troubleshooting that little mix up.","positive":0},{"review":"  We bought 2 of these in preparation for our schools having distance learning this year. My kids were excited to be getting new Chromebooks with big screens.There are so many things to love about this Chromebook and I would still recommend it for casual web browsing and light productivity work. It's just a little underpowered.","positive":0},{"review":"  9 29 17 Update:  After using this for awhile I wish the keyboard had a \"Delete\" key. No issues though.  Exactly what I need for a great price.  Setup was easy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this for my mom, who surfs the internet, reads emails, watches videos.Her old windows 7 computer had slowed down no matter what I did.Cons- Really none, unless you want MS word and things like that loaded in. Otherwise, this is not a con at all.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wasn't too sure about the reviews on this refurbed Acer Chromebook....","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this as soon as I got my taxes back because I needed something if I were to keep writing. I got a Chromebook because I only needed something with basic stuff. I know it's not a touch screen but I had one before this and I kept wanting to select options by touching the screen haha. So it was an adjustment for sure but it works for everything I use it for and I have no real complaints.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought refurbished, had my worries and doubt as I have never bought refurbished before, but read good reviews on the laptop Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6\" HD Premium Chromebook, so decided to take the dive and buy it.  So far so good the computer arrived as expected not in the original packaging, but the laptop was clean and free of any visible damage, there was no scratches and upon starting it, it booted up rather quickly, is fast and the battery life is amazing.  In general very happy with the purchase and it fits my needs without having breaking bank.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent. Use it daily for my remote job. In general \"Love it..","positive":1},{"review":"  So far, very happy with this Chromebook. For my daughter, for college. Very different than a Windows-based computer,  but not too hard to figure out (And there is LOTS off online help and tutorials.)  Would certainly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is exactly what I was looking for. It`s ridiculously easy to set up and use.The price was perfect for me right now too. It came packaged with bubble wrap and a secure box.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I ordered this Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6\" Chromebook that I am currently writing this review on. This isn't my first Chromebook but my old one was smaller so this 15.6\" screen is way better, I just wish it was touch screen.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am so pleasantly surprised to have found this computer. The quality is outstanding and it almost feels like a \"steal\" with how inexpensive it was. All in all, I highly recommend. You cant go we wrong if you need something simple for basic computer needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love everything about my first chromebook (CB3-111) except for in this past year it has shown to be barely adequate for on-line video meetings. It was OK, but often people I was meeting with would complain that my voice would drop out or be delayed. So I took advantage of the 90-day warranty to send it back.  No other issues, regular internet browsing etc was fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  I do not recommend purchasing. I purchased a new version (not refurbished) of the computer for $159.Overall, I would not recommend buying this computer and I am definitely frustrated that I bought it in the first place. This computer makes it pretty difficult to run a successful business.","positive":0},{"review":"  for one thing, not all laptops are created equal.  This was my first experience with the google proprietary system and what a pain it is.  You open the audio player and for the life of me I can't find where to look up files to play from it.  If you are familiar with the google system here then the laptop is a good deal, but for me its just too bulky, awkward, harder to use than it should be.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had to give this a mid rating because the manufacturer stated that I could use the external cd rw with no problem and it wouldn`t connect when I contacted acer I was told that I wouldn`t be able to down load a driver that would work with this laptop nor would I be able to connect my cloud printer. I was disappointed that I bought external items that I was told would work and didn`t. Because it`s run on google is the problem. Would I recommend it yes for for the price I guess you can`t have all the bells and whistles.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop has been a nightmare to use. It is not at all comparable to Microsoft Windows as an operating system. It's been truly awful to use and I recommend avoiding this laptop and the seller, who refused to accept my return. I admit I was slightly past the 30 day window when I tried to make the return, but I was genuinely trying to give myself time to adjust to the laptop, which unfortunately, just did not happen.","positive":0},{"review":"  What a ripoff. I gave 1 star only because it won`t allow me to give none. No damage has been done and this seller doesn`t have anything to other than it`s out of warranty  no I`m sorry you`re having problems since you bought it, or thank you for shopping with us nothing. That`s fine, I may not get any help from this computer but I will make sure no one I know falls for their crappy products.","positive":0},{"review":"  I originally gave this 5 stars as it seems like a nice deal fro the price, however after using it a lot more, the slowness is very frustrating.  Using the Chrome browser, connected to Fios Gigabit internet wifi 5Ghz band, you click something wait 5+ seconds and then it finally starts to display it.  There is like a 5-10 second lag doing most things.  I need this to access work remotely and it is mostly OK, but think I am going to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to like this computer but I don't. Just about everything I try to download on to the computer including my printer setup it states that it is not compatible or does not support the google operating system.I have requested to return this computer but I am expecting to receive a negative response.  I have tried to sell it someone else but after trying to download their programs  (libby and overdrive) and receiving the same message they decided they did not want it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Expect very little and you`ll get exactly that. It`s good for anyone who is broke or doesn`t need a fast working competent laptop.*side note*Amazon Prime Music Unlimted is not compatible with this machine. So, check your favorite apps and streaming services, because you may not get to utilize them with this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have not used the computer yet, so this review is strictly based upon my disappointment upon receipt of product.  Although description clearly states that all relevant accessories are included, there is no power source cord included. although a requested gift. READ EVERYTHING before purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  After being manacled to an ever increasingly logy HP Windows 10, a consistently crashing of IE, which BTW refused to load Chrome browser properly, I bought this Chromebook to replace it.  I have used the Acer 15 CB3-532 (refurbished) every day for one week. I still have to use my Compac MS 10 occasionally and it remains an unpleasant chore because it is so slow. The Chromebook in comparison is pleasantly speedy.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Wow. This refurbished Acer Chromebook is nice.  And she's played hours of spider solitaire laying in bed. She loves it so I'm happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  My'bad' here. This laptop was refurbished, so I tried to save$$$. I will not purchase or recommend an acer product nor use Amazon for the future replacement of this laptop. Again, I see NO REASON why our technologies could turn out such a short lived product.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop is great but if you have it closed sometimes it shuts off unexpectedly, so when you turn it back on you have to restore the tabs you had open.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love my laptop. It is in mint condition. It was a blessing in disguise that my other one broke because I was not 100% satisfied with it.  I feel way more comfortable with the Acer Chromebook 15 for me and my children to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  this has been a great replacement for my apple laptop, which i killed a few months ago. i just couldn't justify the price for a new refurbished even, apple, so i tried this. useful, convenient, easy to carry, and cheap.do be aware that google will follow you around the internet, but then again so do facebook & many other places.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ok so there are some things to cover here.  First, these are used and refurb.  Sure, write, presentation and regular apps.  Multimedia eats memory fast.","positive":1},{"review":"  Finally, something easy to get around on.After 13 years my MacBook Pro reached the end of the support line. WT. Budget friendly, but what an inconvenience.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was my first time making a computer purchase on Amazon. Wasnt a big deal since it was for my kids to do homework and with such a reasonable price i figured why not..very much worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does its' job.  Connects fine to the Internet, gets my email, watches Twitch and YouTube, etc.  The screen could be a little clearer (although I'm old) and I would love a lighted keyboard, but I recommend this computer -- especially at this price point..","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a good basic Chromebook. It worked for my daughter's online classes, the internet, social media and streaming. But I don't think I'd buy recertified again. This was a poor experience.","positive":0},{"review":"  pretty much only purchased this to transfer media files from a broken hp. some of the files work fine, others don`t - i can`t pinpoint the issue. the screen started blinking. i shut the top down and now it won`t charge, turn on, or reboot with the refresh power trick.","positive":0},{"review":"  The spacebar isn't working properly so I have to return it (paid for under 30 day warranty) for repair. I'm waiting for customer service to email me the return case #.00 to return it even though it's damaged. Also Customer service never returned my multiple messages.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased two of these computers for my grandchildren for Christmas.  However, I ordered them in October and when they were opened at Christmas time on of them didn`t work properly.  I felt it was a joke.  Now that my grandkids are using them (and now I also have one to use, not that I needed or wanted it), I hope they last a long time because the warrantee sucks.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the computer as a Christmas gift for my son.. I purchased the 2 year protection but they state that won't cover the operating system. Waist of money that nobody will actually stand behind their product.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought it for my son who only uses it for YouTube and googling information (he has Autism) but I personally wouldn't buy a refurbished computer like this, if you are going to use it for anything too extensive. The computer crashed on the 2nd day.because it said that it had viruses from a porn site. My son does not get on those sites, so it had to be from a previous owner.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product was perfect. It was not what I needed. Or a tween just starting out on their own divice. Again for what I was looking for it was my mistake in this purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  The one I am using is working just fine.  My Wife has no luck for bad luck.  Stops Dead again .  Just remember to check the warrantyit  is very short and is not returnable.","positive":0},{"review":"  the product is very used, and has many visible blows, which classifies it as class C.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I first opened my package, the charger was already damaged. The laptop looked solid and decent for the price, but what's the entire point of using a laptop when you can't even charge it.. What disappointed me the most was the fact that I had to pay for shipping back.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was such a good price that I bought it for my grandson birthday in July. At first I was disappointed because I couldn`t find a charger. He`s going to be so excited.  I couldn`t honestly fill out the gaming quality so I didn`t mark any stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was skeptical in buying a Laptop cause I have a mountain of them, all with noisy fans and short battery life. Was looking for a modern easy to use laptop for my mom as a gift for xmas. Seriously, the picture they have on the sales page for this Computer doesn't do it justice, it is a quantum leap forward in the world of portable PC's, for the casual types not for the gamers. I can see gamer PC's like this possible in the near future, but today Chromebook exceeded all expectations and put my skepticism to rest.","positive":1},{"review":"  Wrote a great review directly to the seller. Purchased for my granddaughter.Love it. Received it in about 3 days.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this Chromebook computer because of the price ($120 \"refurbished,\" but appears new), and because of the large 15\" screen.All my cellphone apps were easily downloaded from the Android Play Store, and they all worked.  If I had to carry it around a lot an 11\" screen is probably more practical.Overall, I'm pleased.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have always been a Microsoft user and i wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I bought this to help my girls with homeschooling projects due to the virus. Its fast performance and lightweight and the batter lasts with use about 9-10 hours. Perfect for long trips in the car.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for something lightweight and fast. This is both of those. I added my VPN, that setup was simple too. The price can't be beat, the screen looks awesome and text size can be modified.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's fine for the money.  I was extremely broke when my last serious laptop that I could use photo editing software on started blue-screening anytime I used it for more then a half hour even when I was using a lap-desk with a fan.  Also, I didn't realize how annoying not having a CAPS lock key would be or how little space 16 gigs or whatever this comes with for memory is these days.  But if you need a cheap web browser and word processor this is fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  Screen is really nice. I watched TV and some other videos on it and it was nice. Mine had no imperfections and looked brand new. Came in great bubble wrap packaging in a box.","positive":1},{"review":"  The item is just as expected. It looks and works like new and definitely will see us through this season of pandemic-driven home school. Open both ends of your box to save yourself the hassle and embarrassment. Nice product, great seller.","positive":1},{"review":"  First of all,recognize that I am not the primary user of this laptop.  I bought it  for a person who could not afford a computer and was stuck inside due to Covid19 .  So far it has performed very well.  It does not have a touch screen, but that is fine with her.","positive":1},{"review":"  Okay product if you are looking to play google play games only.  Because it is basically a phone built into a laptop.  So I went to my local pawn shop that I purchased my previous laptop and desktop computer from( to see if they got anything good in stock) and they do not accept nor sell any type of chromebook for the very reason I am returning mine (FYI).  Hope this help someone.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm the idiot who didn't spring for a warranty on this, but this is my third Acer device.  My prior two have been steadfast. My point is I just read, write, and listen to music on Chromebook, and everything about its performance is poor.Shell out for the warranty if you buy this junk.","positive":0},{"review":"  False advertising.. I am ok with the size. I want a refund for the difference.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received the laptop and loved it. I'm not too picky. Now, i'm thinking it's an issue with the model. I need it to edit photos, so this issue is very frustrating for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  Sadly, we had our 8 year old using this for months before we realized it was dysfunctional. The video and microphone do not function properly with zoom. What a shame that our child has struggled with school learning for 6 months and it was this product that was to blame. Too late to return, but warning to all--refurbished was a lemon for us and we didnt even know it for too long.","positive":0},{"review":"  The computer won't even turn on only a few months in.  I've tried all of the official hard reset and restart methods and nothing works.","positive":0},{"review":"  The screen is broken in less than two months and the Acer Refurbished Store is saying tough luck. Really.. Save your money and get something that won`t break after 2 months you can`t return.","positive":0},{"review":"  My daughter needed something for distance learning so I decided to grab this laptop since the price was great. Unfortunately, after 3 days the screen went completely black and I had to return it. I think I will stay away from refurbished in the future.","positive":0},{"review":"  the only thing I liked about this \"laptop\" was its size.Its start up menu was not easily accessible. It would shut down at least 2-3 times in a row.If you are use to a computer with a start up menu and icons easily seen and understood, this is NOT for you.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just got it and it will not power upI read previous buyers that they had the same problem, bad faulty power cordSent the refurbishment place a messageWe will see how fast they are going to take care of this.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an Amazon Renewed Product and I was Amazed ....","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it. It runs fast, I can watch YouTube Netflix no problem, the sound is decent, the screen is really big and it's easy to use. Haven't met a webpage I cant load.  Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update- I`m expecting some minor glitching with my Chrome, when I open it sometimes it doesn`t load properly so I can`t see anything I have had to minimize than enlarge for it to work and sometimes you can`t see typed text. I have warranty so I will contact them to see what`s going on, otherwise Im still loving my laptop. It`s now Mid January and so far great. Acer products are becoming more of a better and stable brand on the market.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a sleek, ready to use set up, Windows based computer.  Everything Windows based transfers in, and I was using it immediately after opening it up.Be aware that some games and apps aren't usable, unlike on my laptop. If there's a way to make them work, I'd rather just find something that is compatible.","positive":1},{"review":"  Not sure which review is which. I ordered onenl in which the fedex guy delivered to da wrong house. But the speed, Quality, design make it my go to machine.Time will tell,No telling what the other ChroneBk is like.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was skeptical, due to the fact that this computer costs less than 250. My mindset was of the idea of \"You get what you pay for. The battery is a hard A+ and these units show that Chromebooks have come a long way and have applications that prevent you from having to settle.I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter recently change schools and at their old school they needed Apple but at her new school she's used Chromebook. To get a Chromebook at this price is so worth it she is so excited and has no problem navigating through different websites. I'm absolutely buying another one for my sons.  The seller was super nice and sent me an e-mail asking to rate the chrome book and if I have any problems email him which I thought it was very kind.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was not looking for the best, top of the line, or even anything super good.  I purchase this computer because it is cheap and it was strictly for web browsing and charting while I am at work.  It can be slow, especially if you are running anything more than 1 or 2 applications at once.  Otherwise, I purchased the refurbished model and a year and a half later it continues to still work for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop is EXTREMELY fast, much better than I anticipated.  I use it to do homework while watching TV, instead of using our desktop.  This was one of the best purchases I've made in the past couple of years.  You usually get what you pay for, but this is a bargain and a great machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my first chromebook and although I am still confused at how to get it to do some things that I've always done on Windows PC, I am impressed. This doesn't act like a refurbished item at all and is very fast. I almost missed it myself and was worried I would have to return. Overall, I really like it even though I'm new to chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's OK--I was disappointed that after just a few months the action on the touchpad would deteriorate to the point where we can't use it to scroll down anymore on the screen and have to use the arrow keys--the action was always a little \"sticky\" from the get-go but now, it's even worse.","positive":0},{"review":"  Chromebooks are not compatible with many applications or programs which PCs and Macs are.  I am in school online having huge issues not being able to get certain programs apps as this is very limited.  Beware.  Its cheap for a reason.","positive":0},{"review":"  Fails to recognize most of my files. Difficult to do even the simplist tasks. Fails to recognize video extentions, will stop playing in the middle of a video.  Not worth the money, yes cheap is cheap here.","positive":0},{"review":"  I just got this a few days ago, and it sucks. It`s slow, I can`t access simple things, and it just sucks. If you need to, just splurge on a MacBook or something. Did I mention how much it sucks.","positive":0},{"review":"  The touchpad is the worst Ive ever seen. It stops, it drags, locks up, and when it does work finding the bar on right is a whole new annoyance in itself. They say you get what you pay for.  I trusted the reviews as always.","positive":0},{"review":"  Crappiest computer ever cant do anything in it. Cant even transfer photos from a usb drive.","positive":0},{"review":"  Lasted one day.  A real blooper..I ain't giving up my Amazon Prime, I love it but this experience was a real warning sign.","positive":0},{"review":"  Used this everyday for six weeks for a class and worked great. Then after about two months the batter won`t charge more than 11%. Super disappointing.","positive":0},{"review":"  We purchased this chromebook for a friend whose son needed it for distance learning. After only two months of using it, it stopped working. There are simply no guarantees. I wanted this to be a great option for us, but in the end it wasn`t.","positive":0},{"review":"  Sadly this was a gift for my nephew who is a freshman in college. He has had significant trouble getting the laptop to connect to wi-fi, which has been problematic for him doing his course work. I had hoped, even though it is refurbished, it would provide good working quality. I would not purchase it again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Slow computer. Hard to use more than a few tabs at once. As a dirt cheap backup PC for emailing and streaming, this laptop definitely gets the job done. For more complicated tasks, you're going to be sitting around waiting for the job to complete.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very pleased with this purchase. I got it my my high schooler to do her homework on. This is my second Acer  Chromebook purchase (I use one for my business) and I like Chromebook better than my Macbook mainly because I can connect to internet anywhere I go. My Mac always gave me problems.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my first laptop Chromebook. I am everything Google, so this works out perfectly. Their is 2 scratch marks barely noticeable on the casing, but other than that and for the price of under $150.00 I feel I got an awesome deal.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve had this for several months now. I replaced my desktop with it and never looked back. Has sizable quality built in speakers. Case is not the sturdiest, but I wouldn`t expect it to be for this price, and it`s no more flimsy than the case on our $700 Lenovo laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent price. I know it was refurbished but you wouldn't know it. Easy to operate and fast. Also, don't forget that it has its own Antivirus build right in the computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  i had this for about 7 months and its still going strong. it hasn't broke down on me yet. if you want a buy a laptop without spending 500-1000 dollars(im looking at you apple.) go for a chromebook and its incredibly fast once you turned it on it only takes less then 3-2 minutes to turned on.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Chrome book looked like brand new and works great. You have to be connected to the internet to use it. The built in storage is just to operate the device, not for downloading and saving lots of data. If you just want to be able to browse the internet without having to worry about viruses and malware this is for you.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased for my son.  Others had more features, but my son wanted a large screen and he was initially very happy.\"  Unfortunately, as far as I know, it is too late for an exchange. I would be thrilled to purchase him a better one.","positive":1},{"review":"  My grandson had to give the chromebook he was using back to the school at the end of the school year.  I wanted him to keep in practice with a chromebook over the summer so he will be familiar with it so I bought this one for him.  I am impressed with how much they use it to chat on line with friends and connect with learning websites.  I am glad I bought this for them.","positive":1},{"review":"  I rushed and ordered this online but this is not a regular laptop it is a Chromebook. It is my fault actually I should of read entirely before ordering. But I will keep this computer around. But I only used it once.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had to purchase a computer from the seller in May that did not have any issues however this computer literally stopped working on the 91st day and they did not honor the extended warranty that was on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a traditional laptop user and was looking for an inexpensive personal laptop.  My fault for not researching more.I returned it. If you want a tablet style laptop for cheap this might be for you but if you want a traditional laptop you might be disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like this Chrome book. A lot..Good luck.","positive":0},{"review":"  Restarted continuously right out of the box and did not include a power cable as well. It was a waste of my time and energy. I wish I got get a refund on the two days I lost because I thought I had purchased a computer that would work.If this computer was Amazon certified do I dare risk buying another computer from an Amazon vender.","positive":0},{"review":"  I found it very difficult to get help on the phone and could not understand their explanation's.  They also pushed me on to someone else it seemed like the person I spoke to did not have the knowledge to change thing he had to send me to tech support which was not available when I tried to call.","positive":0},{"review":"  Have barely used it, haven't had the time to really use it. Crack open afew tabs and it froze. It's not lag.Disappointed was going to use it for school.","positive":0},{"review":"  got this to replace my 12 yr old laptop that had screen problems and nearly dead (2nd) battery. also wanted one with ssd.. so much im contacting geeks to find out if there is a way to dump it and get windows 10.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my God daughter who is in the 11th grade once the pandemic started so she can keep up with school. Its worked fine for the 7th months she had and and just stopped working. Its passed the return period and I can not afford to buy a new one. Even tho it was $119, it still should be still working.","positive":0},{"review":"  I didn't have a problem with this machine until right after the 30 day return window expired. I have been having technical issues shortly after. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a product seller. I will not buy an ACER product ever again due to this experience and have bought Chromebooks from other manufacturers as gifts and they are still up and running for years.","positive":0},{"review":"  It has adequate performance for general web browsing. The screen is not that great (resolution is 720p, sensitive to angle). No prob w  refurb.","positive":0},{"review":"  I only use it for browsing the web, but it works beautifully. Boots up really fast and does not have dozens of icons on the screen that confuse people who are not computer-savvy. but I didn't try any FPS type games. Google Earth works wonderfully, though, if that's any indication of video capability.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to replace a 6 year old Samsung Chromebook which I have loved until it finally quit.  This Acer is much bigger with its 15.So far I love it, and will update if I find it isn't what I thought, but I bought it for the price, size, and the fact that it was a Chromebook.  Very impressed with the quality so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my Partner to replace an older chromebook. She loves it. I never thought about buying Refurbished, but now I'm sorry that I didn't do it before. I bought a new laptop at Best Buy and could have gotten a much better one that was refurbished for the price that I paid.","positive":1},{"review":"  Our kid can't seem to hang on to not spill juice on not randomly ruin laptops.We purchased this re-furbished Chromebook because it's so cheap {sorry, kiddo.The Chromebook has a great battery life (all day if he's using it for school work.)AND the kid (while he misses his long line of gaming laptops) actually likes the Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  One of the laptops did give me a bit of a hard time logging into the network.

Hope this helps\ud83d\ude42.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great product at an affordable price. My kids needed this when school closed due to Covid. I did and then he was fine with it. For a such a low price, I'm very happy with this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ordered for my mom who is 75 years old and needs a basic computer.Although she complains that it is too heavy for her (she has weak upper body strength), it serves it's purpose.CHECK THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX FOR THE CHARGER BEFORE YOU THROW IT AWAY. IT was hidden in the box and I had to read the reviews thoroughly to check for it before I called Amazon.","positive":1},{"review":"  It literally has been shutting down randomly 15 times a day since I got it. It boots up pretty fast and keep my windows the same, so I wouldnt have a probably if it only did a few times a day.EDIT: The shutting down only seems to happen if I have more than 1 tab opened, but now there is a shadow patch on the bottom of my screen. I would recommend you spend 40 dollars more on a product that actually works.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to use for Zoom calls. When I tried a call with about 10 attendees they couldn't hear me. It turns out that Zoom publishes a minimum RAM of 4GB and this has only 2GB. Don't make the same mistake as me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I know it is a 30 day return and 90 day warranty but when you  use it only about 12 times in that period there should be some consolation not just lose all that money or take it somewhere for repair  that cost as much as the laptop did. they need to check it better or don't sell reconditioned.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worst computer I have ever had. cant use my security . and if you do not like it you pay to ship it back and lose more. I got mine for sale.","positive":0},{"review":"  I usually advocate for refurb products but this thing just died and wont charge or turn on. Tried the reset procedure multiple times with no luck. If you buy this thing, factor in the price for the warranty from square trade because you are going to need it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The Chromebook started fine. But would not let me sign in or setup unless i was in guest mode. Yes i had internet connected and functioning properly. I powerwashed it to reset the system and it did not fix the issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is garbage.  Worked for about a week. The person I spoke with said it must be a software issue and it was out of its 90 day warranty.  Lesson learned.","positive":0},{"review":"  The screen is big.. It could just be that the keys are tightly spaced and don't have any gaps like the other keyboards I've been used to typing on..","positive":0},{"review":"  Entered a password and it requested a previous one.  Can't use it now.  Out $129.00.","positive":0},{"review":"  I regret buying this computer. Slow to operate, and not great for working mobile. Fine machine for email and simple web browsing.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is my first Chromebook PC. I bought this refurbished so I didn't expect perfection, but it's just right for me until I upgrade to soemething else. on the mouse on the touchpad. The price was great too.","positive":1},{"review":"  My kids took over my other computers, so I decided to get one of my own.  I enjoy the convenience of having a personal computer where all my passwords are mine, etc.  I don't use it for gaming or music, so I can't say how it would do for that.  It holds a charge very well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed a laptop for using in the various facilities I work in.  There are never enough laptops for staff and I have found it better to bring my own.  Seller shipped quickly and it came in a timely manner.  I'm very happy with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my cousin who is going through rehab from minor strokes and is temporarily in a live in facility.  As you can imagine, there is not much to do.  Has been very easy to set-up and use.  Only complaint is that the charger didn't hold up and had to replace it within the first few weeks.","positive":1},{"review":"  Like the fast boot time, quick maintenance update time and value (lower cost).  Google's Chrome browser and Google brand Apps work great.  I'm not a \"power-user\" and sometimes wait patiently a few seconds for an app to refresh or respond to a mouse click.  Occasionally, perhaps monthly, the screen \"freezes\" and I must press and hold down the power button for many seconds to power off on the device.","positive":1},{"review":"  My old machine was not updateable anymore, so crashed repeatedly.  This is a good replacement for someone who is not computer savvy and just needs the basics to access the internet, email, etc.  A good size screen for the money too.  And could not beat the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  My Mom is 80 and has her laptop on 24 hours a day with social media, etc.  Her computer died..I feel Guilty.","positive":1},{"review":"  I give this 5 stars.First, it's only very inexpensive computer. Be aware it is Google-centric and takes a google account to fully access all features.I have not tried games or anything like that on the computer but I am impressed with the machine compared to my daughter's Chromebook computer (3-4 years old), it's much snappier and the screen is much better in brightness and clarity.","positive":1},{"review":"  How many chromebooks have I owned.  Maybe 6.  This larger model will stay on my desk where the screen is big and good enough for me to ignore the TV.  I have had HP and Samsung but like Acer the best.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far so good. I was concerned with all the negative reviews but my Chromebook showed up looking brand new and is functional. Really happy with performance so far. I really only use it for the internet churching emails watching videos so it's perfect for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am beyond disappointed in this purchase .I recently discover that the volume control keys don't work on the laptop and also it's extremely slow and constantly freezing up...","positive":0},{"review":"  Ordered it on the 17th and received it on the 22nd (once again 2 day shipping is non existent from Amazon).Setting it up now, so far so good.* Speakers are just ok - nothing to write home about but they do the basic job. My biggest issue with this chromebook is the lack of color depth.","positive":0},{"review":"  Poor screen quality and very small keyboard. Asked for seller permission to return and I had to take it to the post office and pay $21.. I still haven`t heard from the seller about anything concerning my return.","positive":0},{"review":"  Maybe i got a bad one, but it is incredibly slow. It takes about 15 seconds to load a photo from the hard drive and a good few minutes just to recognize a device has been attached. Every thing about it is obnoxiously slow. I would not recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`m a little disappointed with this. It looks and feels great. My old Acer chrome book never had these issues. Not sure why this would be different, but it is.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ok depending on what you're using it for. I bought it for my 5 year old who was virtual learning.","positive":0},{"review":"  Save your money and buy a new product. This was my second chromebook and the screen cracked for no apparent reason just after 1. I never leave negative reviews but I just need to warn you when you buy this refurbished product. I guess I got what I paid for.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a good system for the price. However, out of the box it was very slow and lagged quite a bit compared to other 4g ram systems I have had.","positive":0},{"review":"  Slower than our previous one.  Touch pad is nor as accurate as previous version but nothing terrible.Charging cord a bit shorter too.For the money it is fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  Who made this keyboard. It's impossible to type the usual way b c keys are all over the place. It keeps freezing when attempting to access notifications and jack for headphones barely works.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was a gift,  they are very happy with their Acer... as long as they are happy I am happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this Acer computer. I have never owned an Acer before but it seems to get the job done for what I use it for, which is mostly email and searches.  I like the separate numerical keyboard better but this is fine for the cost.The price was right and it serves my purpose well.","positive":1},{"review":"  This 15.6\" used Acer Chromebook works as well as the 14\" one I bought about four or five years ago. While the battery, processor, and RAM size are all average (and that's not to say bad), the bright, clear screen is a real stand-out: I can easily watch movies or YT on here without missing the TV screen. Very pleased with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this after returning another chromebook that felt flimsy and was so slow. The great part is I only paid $30 more for this one that has a bigger screen, solid construction, and fast processing. Buy it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The screen is very big for viewing. I bought this computer for my mother because she has a hard time seeing and because it's a Chromebook it's very easy for her to use and see.  The only thing she uses computers for is to go onto the internet all she has to do is turn it on open chrome that's it. I highly recommend this computer economic and has high quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am agraid to get a chromebook because a lot of reviews claim they do not stream hulu or Netflix. I have found the computer does just that without any problems. I am getting use to the performance quirks, like no right clicking the traditional way and some other things. But a quick trip to google solved all my problems.","positive":1},{"review":"  Something new for me send learn. Love that it synced with my smartphone.Words was easy to download but still looking for two lot of my apps.Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law. The unit shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. It looks good on the refurbish  (no scratches or markings)  and seemed to work well for about the first month and then she started having problems with two of the keys on the keyboard sticking. It doesn't make it unusable, it's just frustrating to her, otherwise I would have given it five stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought these for the kids to do their schoolwork since schools were closed and the District issued screens are so small. I didn't want then squinting at small screens all day. Very happy. The kids were happy, also.","positive":1},{"review":"  Needed this laptop to stream online video to a weekly group.  Works well and the picture is very clear.  Well worth the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Will not boot up. Amazon wants me to pay to have it returned.Amazon refunded my money after fighting with them. Acer Recertified wouldn`t help and just insisted it left there working.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is not touch screen, chrome books are awful, I wish I would have known this info before buying all a chromebook is is an oversized android device, that you litterly cant do anything on.","positive":0},{"review":"  Have had problems with this product from the beginning. Less than four months after I bought it it just died. I don't have the technical skill to deal with faulty equipment and now I just wasted this money. Very unhappy.","positive":0},{"review":"  (1)  it's poorly developed, very buggy and not a stable platform(2) Google constantly bugged its user with tons of  security alerts.","positive":0},{"review":"  IT HAD A VIRUS PROBLEM WAS ALLIEVIATED SUCCESSFULLY, WITH A REPLACEMENT.","positive":0},{"review":"  Started it up and within the first 15 minutes of use after the camera began functioning inconsistently, the browser was slow even with 5G internet connection, and the wallpaper refused to be changed because of \"network issues.\"  I normally do not struggle with technology and have loved my chromebooks over the years.  No thank you.","positive":0},{"review":"  old and big.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop worked fine for 3 weeks then started to freeze and the delays from typing to posting are increasing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Runs super slow.

It arrived quickly, clean, and in like-new condition.","positive":1},{"review":"  I liked that the computer turned on when I opened the lid. It was easy to navigate, once I got my bearings.It does not have the touch screen option and it was hard to readjust to that.Overall a great computer, and the refurbished price was great as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m retired now and simply don`t need a power laptop with a ton of space anymore.  This also works great with my tiny 1 terabyte external drive. Amazing deal at $160.  Arrived blemish free.","positive":1},{"review":"  The acer chromebook is great along with the seller.

This would have been the perfect laptop if it was also a touch screen.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is incredibly basic, but for the price you couldn`t really ask for much more. It is for browsing the web and literally only that, has no other functions. Battery life is good and I am getting up to 6 hours of use at a time.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this for my granddaughter as hers had died and she needed it for the kids school.

Recommended to a friend for similar use and she likes it too.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product. It doesn't have touch screen but I don't really need one. It otherwise is great.

The three things that I don't like about it compared to my Acer Chromebook are:- The volume isn't loud enough. If you have the Chromebook on your lap or bed, the speakers get covered and hard to hear even at full volume sometimes. If you use headphones or use it on a hard desk, it's fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  screen is horrable....","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved my Acer chromebook 14 (screen a little to small but other than that..

A lot of times when I get a device with many technical features the manuals are written poorly in broken English.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for a camping trip, but ended up using it during the 10 10 2019 PG&E power shutdown in San Jose. We didn't have electricity for 16 hours and this little gadget saved my sanity. Was able to charge my iphone and tablet, listening to the radio made me feel less anxious, used as a light, etc. Very handy to have for emergencies and outside adventures.","positive":1},{"review":"  I thought this would be the perfect all in one device for camping and it really is. Although I haven`t had the chance to actually use it in nature it has been perfect for 2 patio cocktail nights. Best part is the crank handle in case there is no sun to charge it. I usually never read instruction manuals but with this I did have to break down and actually open the booklet to set the clock and such and will actually keep it in the kitchen junk drawer instead of tossing them like I do with most products.","positive":1},{"review":"  A great product to have around for camping and power outages. I purchased thinking we would use for camping, but we have been part of all the CA power outages and this product has proven to be super useful.. I highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great design, there are so many features to explore on this unit and it is just the right size. We recently used this during a power outage. I was glad to learn it had weather channels too. I can't wait to take it camping.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this when PG&E decided to start imposing electricity shut offs during windy weather. I haven't had to use it (fortunately). So far, I am happy with this purchase. I haven't tested the charging effectiveness via solar panel or hand crank, so I cannot comment upon that.","positive":1},{"review":"  This unit came as a surprise.

It has many other features that make this an excellent choice for home, or when camping.","positive":1},{"review":"  Loving this handy, camping emergency radio. Lots of great features I really need to explore more but, my initial impression is that it`s perfect for camping and if there were an emergency. this is a cool device that works well and would make a great present for anyone\u2026. like maybe one of my friends that just went through power outages in CA.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm using this radio for camping so I like this radio because it's compact, rugged, sounds good and the light function is ideal. The radio wi-fi's to my phone for music. Since it's a survival radio if power is down then so will radio reception and cell phone music too.Given all this I think that I will be happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really enjoy using my Eton \"Sidekick\".  I was really happy knowing that I had a few different ways of charging the radio, I really liked how well it charged with the solar cell. Really not an issue, but in this day and age we are so used to pressing a button and having an immediate reaction, but like I said this slight delay is the ONLY thing I could find wrong with this product.  Definitely worth the purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  The buttons are hidden under the handle and they have impossibly tiny writing so remember to pack a magnifying glass and your reading glasses with this radio.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`ve been using my Eton for a few weeks now and it`s a cool gadget. The crank charger works well and powers my cell phone within minutes. And flip out base legs.)I like it and find it very useful overall.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had high hopes for this product because it was an \"Eton\" radio but the DESIGN is so POOR that it is unusable in an emergency when the lights go out.  I will be returning this item. The good news:  I like the light box. It's pretty bright.","positive":0},{"review":"  Another cheaply-made Chinese piece of junk. All plastic. I wish this would work out for my camping needs, but it obviously will not. Still looking for a Sangean Grundig radio That's rugged enough for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is very difficult to program, but we got it done. It issue is it doesn't work. It did not make a peep. It doesn't work.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for my wife. She didn't like how big it was but her main issue was the fact that it wobbled.Didn't like that some of the controls were hidden under the handle.We returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  As other reviewers have observed, the idea of hiding the teensy buttons used to program and operate this device about an inch under the handle and label them with even teensier writing seems to run contrary to the idea of it being something to use in an emergency.My first couple of experiences in trying to set it up: (After getting out the magnifying glass both for the radio itself and the manual.E. alerts and gives you a lot of choices for customizing what alerts you want to hear.","positive":0},{"review":"  We got this for our 84 year old mom and I don`t recommend it for the elderly. They can`t see the buttons, they can`t see or hear nearly anything on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not work, contacted Eton and all they said was return it. Did not even try to troubleshoot.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product page falsely stated the solar panel will charge the device in 5-6 hours. The manual says 14 -16 hours. Sound quality is acceptable, but there's no bass, so don't expect this to become your new music player of choice. Radio reception is very good for a handheld radio.","positive":0},{"review":"  Weight-lightweight.easy to carry.When the sun is shy & refusing to come out as well as blacked out  occurs,cannot rely on solar & wall charging during these moments.Hand crank is my go-to choice.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just got this product the other day and I absolutely love it. It is lightweight and easily portable. Radio has good sound and is easily connectable to my phone via the bluetooth. And I might add the cellphone charging port is a huge bonus.","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio was purchased with a certain degree of skepticism, assuming it was a another example of an over-hyped tech product that failed to meet marketing claims.  In fact, it is quite capable, with good reception, excellent battery life and versatility.  The control buttons along the top are somewhat difficult to read and operate, being located underneath the carry handle, but otherwise as a weather alert NOAA receiver and radio charger area light it's the real deal.","positive":1},{"review":"  First off, the seller just threw this radio in a plastic bag. No instructions, no thank you note for buying their product. At times it falls over. Would have given five stars without these issues .","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything you want from a disaster prep emergency radio in a solid, rugged, and durable looking housing.

I totally recommend this multi-function device.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bluetooth option to stream your own music as well as listening to the radio solid model very bright flashlight with two options where the whole back is lit up or similar to handheld with one beam.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been working out great. I bought it for emergency use, but have enjoyed having it on the edge of my hot tub so I can listen to music or sports while in the tub. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I have been unable to charge my iPhone with this. Not sure if I`m doing something wrong or I misinterpreted the description of the item.","positive":1},{"review":"  Don't lose the manual or you will be SOL. It's got buttons and a handle that you can spin. It is rather complicated to use though and prob has a bunch of features that I don't even know about. It's great.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little radio exceeds all my expectations. I have a small rack on my front forks and I put a piece of foam underneath this radio and strap it down and go.  I had originally passed on this radio because of the price but I got lucky and found it on sale.  Now that I know how well it works I would buy it again even at the regular price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a well-designed, rugged and multi-functional device that is essential in emergencies when the power is out. Having the hand-crank and the solar panels for generating power for the device is extremely handy, in addition to providing power for other usb-powered devices including cellphones. It's lightweight to carry around but also seems durable if it gets dropped or knocked around. For future iterations I wonder if a wireless charging coil could be added to provide wireless charging for cell phones as I can imagine situations where a usb charging cable may not be available.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the most frustrating electronic device I have ever purchased.  The manual is poorly written and confusing.  In addition, the tiny control buttons are hidden under the handle with very little illumination, making them difficult to read without using a separate flashlight.  Overall a very disappointing, difficult to use product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Stopped working right after 30 days of having it. Will not turn on at all. And because it`s 30 days after purchase I am unable to return. VERY disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Will not charge all the way no matter how long it sits in the sun.

Or those folding binoculars that included a whistle and compass.. if you can't get a clear radio signal you have to check if you accidentally enabled cell charging, and this happens way more often than you'll actually use the cell charger, since it's equivalent to a very small portable USB battery bank.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love microscopic print and cryptic crossword puzzles. This radio will provide hours of entertainment...","positive":0},{"review":"  The sound quality is really good as well as picking up the emergency weather. The solar power and wind up charger are almost pointless they would only be for emergency.

Cloud, baby.Update on Thanksgiving - At $449, this thing is a freakin' steal.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have two of the previous Samsung entry level Chromebooks, both of which have become slower over time.  They have been optimally tuned.  Also includes hi res HD display, touchscreen, and a stylus.  Go for it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is great. battery lasts me a full day without the need to recharge.For the price (449.99$ on black Friday), a great machine for web browsing, youtube and light work.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've used Chromebooks for years as my everyday laptop. This 2nd generation Plus with an M3 satisfies all my normal needs and wants.  The plastic bottom creeks a bit, the only indication this is not a solid all metal body. I paid around $500 and that is an amazing value for a laptop that performs this well.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Samsung XE520QAB is not my first Chromebook household purchase (purchased one for my son who is in elementary school three years ago), and I'm a teacher who utilizes Chromebooks during classroom instruction often. thus, I'm not new to Chromebooks. I prematurely tried to connect to the Maker using the Bluetooth settings menu of the Chromebook instead of initially connecting within the Design Studio app, which may have led to connection problems. The devices connected eventually, and I have not experienced any further issues with the Chromebook relating to my Cricut Maker.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchase this Chromebook for school, and I am loving it so far. I easily set up all the same apps I have on my Samsung that I would need, as well as the apps required for my online courses with no issue. The casing is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but easily wipes off so no harm no foul. Overall I would recommend this device.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, I really like this Chromebook. I like the fact that it has a built-in stylus that upon removing allows you to write handwritten notes that automatically go into Google Keep. For the money, this represents a better value than getting a Pixelbook. Samsung should have either 1) designed the second USB-C port further away from the first one on the left side of the device, or 2) designed the second USB-C port on the right side of the unit.","positive":1},{"review":"  Who ever said that chromebooks were trash. Well I did. everything was there and i saw no fingerprints on it. Works fine looks good but I paid full price for an opened box and that pisses me off.","positive":0},{"review":"  Fraud. Scam.

Had to send it back for a refund. Otherwise, unit seemed pretty nice except for horrible owner's manual. Don't really know about battery life since I couldn't run it for long.","positive":0},{"review":"  Battery died after 9 months..  I have several Samsung products in my house so very surprised of the poor quality I'm seeing here.  I cannot recommend a Samsung Chromebook to anyone.","positive":0},{"review":"  I REALLY REALLY wanted to like it. I was REALLY hoping for a good experience with transitioning from Macbook PRO to chromebook since most of my workflow would be on the internet but 400 bucks down a hole and full of regrets that I hoped the chromebook could \"handle\" more than web browsing. At least reboots fast.- Has done the chromebook wash multiple times- Got rid of all the extensions one at a time- Has deleted then re-installed Apps (only a few)Gotten to the point where multiple crashes a day is now just part of the workflow until the new laptop comes after a period of denial and disappointment.","positive":0},{"review":"  DO NOT BUY THIS CHROMEBOOK. I just bought it and when I turned it on it had someone else's login information on it and he was listed as the owner. I will keep everyone updated if the situation changes. But stay away from this seller.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall this laptop is fairly good.  The screen and keyboard are quite decent, and most apps from the play store work fine.  Since I have been using the laptop daily this is a big inconvenience.  I'll end up just buying a new charger myself, but I'll definitely avoid Samsung in the future with these types of warranty policies.","positive":0},{"review":"  Plastic and not Aluminum like the previous model, speakers are weak and wifi is weak.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ordered the Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 (Model XE520QAB-K02US) as a replacement for my Samsung Chromebook Pro which I passed on to my wife because her 6-year old Samsung Chromebook was no longer receiving updates. Received it yesterday and was shocked to see that it has an Intel Core m3 7th Generation processor (see photo of label) and not the 8th Generation depicted in Amazon's advertising. All plastic makes it very flexible and it just feels cheap, more like a $200 chromebook and not the build quality you'd expect in a chromebook in this price range. Will be sending back, expecting a full refund because it is not as advertised.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have owned the original Samsung Chromebook Plus for three years now, have generally been satisfied, especially as the maturation of the Chrome OS has progressed.  A cracked screen that was only marginally annoying, and some mysterious problems with its WIFI capability caused me to consider a change, but the costs for the performance gains I wanted from a switch didn't seem worth the cost.  Buy one of these beauties now. you'll be glad you did.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a Samsung fan and was not disappointed with this as my first Chromebook. As to performance, faster than my windows laptop for startup but for navigating and applications its about the same but I'm running an i7 on my laptop. I wouldnt describe this as light weight and it's a bit bulkier than my win laptop. Battery life has been much better on my chromebook though.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been a happy Android user for a long and I always wanted to try Chrome OS, but I was too afraid to leave the Windows ecosystem because of my job (I sometimes needed certain software that was only available for Windows). After I switched job, I finally decided to give it a try. It's still there and it's a plus for anyone that may take advantage of it.I would definitely recommend this Chromebook (for the price I got it).","positive":1},{"review":"  Works well, the Stylus is a great touch. It is Chrome OS so you get what you pay for.this browser machine crushes it. Enjoy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was skeptical, for the price for the touch screen to be as responsive as it is, I use the Chromebook for digital art with a collection of s-pen stylus .  All work perfectly, the only issue i have had is learning that chrome os is quite different from Android.  But I believe that it is very well comparable.","positive":1},{"review":"  Quality product, works like a charm. Flexible convertible.Operates seamlessly, superior to mac or windows.Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really love this Chromebook.  It's super fast.  I'm very happy with my choice to purchase this Chromebook. It is worth every penny.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice as an tablet and a laptop. I expected it to be just like my Note 10, but my Note 10 cost twice as much. Its durable, but very lightweight. Overall nice.","positive":1},{"review":"  So i had this computer chromebook for a year now, and i got to say. This is a very good device. I bough a logitech mouse so its not a big deal for me, but even when i'm not home, i simply navigate using the touch screen so it doesnt effect me. I'm hook with chromebooks, if one day i ever need another one, i know what i will be looking for.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had an Asus Chromebook but it was very laggy. I purchased the Samsung Chromebook and it so far has been very fast. I also like the stylus of this Chromebook. Good buy would definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  My son needed a replacement Chromebook, so I picked this one up on \"Prime Day\".  It has been a great replacement, but I was disappointed to learn from my son that it \"was no longer charging\".Otherwise this Chromebook has been a good decent chromebook.  For those that know chromebooks, you know what that means.","positive":0},{"review":"  Using this computer as a work computer during the pandemic, I found that it would get sluggish after a while with a number of tabs open (15 or so, running apps like slack, office365, webex, VDI, gmail, google drive), to the point where I would have to reboot at least daily. A couple of times the computer froze, probably from intense usage.This computer is probably best for casual personal use rather than intense multi-tasking. At just under $500, it's a question if there isn't a cheaper chromebook out there that would be fine for casual level usage.","positive":0},{"review":"  TLDR:  Hinge broke.  Would not buy another (third) one. However, none of that really matters if it is going to disintegrate in a few months.  Yes, I know, this really should be a one star review.","positive":0},{"review":"  Today our Samsung XE520QAB-K02US Chromebook Plus V2 stopped working. I purchased it August 2019, it lasted 14 months. Then back to blank. Very disappointed it did not last longer.","positive":0},{"review":"  I guess I should have the 2 stars because what I was expecting and what I got were very different.  I thought it would work like my Samsung tablet and or my Samsung phone.All in all, I'll stick with my macbooks.

I still think it`s too early and that`s what I tell everyone that ask me about it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Screen broke right off in less than a year after purchase.

This Chromebook is superfast and just what I needed between my phone and a full laptop.  I'm not a Google person, so have had some challenges loading Hotmail, Firefox and other favorite apps, but once I got it done, it's easy to work around.  It goes on sale with Amazon several time during the year, so don't pay full price.","positive":1},{"review":"  I already had laptop, but it was too big and a bit heavy for me carry around for school purposes, so I decided to get something smaller and lighter.

The machine works flawlessly for general every day and offi e tasks. Worth what I paid for it.","positive":1},{"review":"  In general it functions well. Unfortunately the touch screen is not sensitive enough. Whether this is a Chromebook issue or computer issue is unknown. However, it can be irritating.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for a computer for everyday use and used to have a MacBook Pro. After 8 years it was time for an upgrade but I don`t want to spend MacBook money. Adjusting to the google apps from the Microsoft office suite took a little time but I could do everything I want. My only critique is that the computer cant connect on airplanes because most airline apps aren`t configured for the chrome book but that seems like an easy fix as more people buy them.","positive":1},{"review":"  It has been a great little computer for my teens to use for school, especially for the price. so much so that we bought one for each and a third for my husband's online teaching needs. The battery life is actually quite good given you can go almost an entire day without charging (and that's using it almost constantly). BUT it loses a star because the charger has now died on 2 of the 3 units that we purchased less than a year ago.","positive":1},{"review":"  was looking for a very lightweight 2 and 1 that was easy to use. this is not iy.s bulky, awkward and the \"pen\" is almost impossible to pull out for use (other reviews had that warning).If it suits you it might be a value for the price point.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent nice and thin and light Chromebook. Slide in out stylus a huge plus. It is fast and in case anyone wonders it has Crostini Linux beta and loading Linux and Libreoffice and other Linux Apps works just fine.

None were successful.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use this every day for full-stack development using Cloud9.

I just got fed up straining my voice over classrooms of children who don't listen unless someone is shouting.

Yes, kids do get yelled at in school because lots of times they don't respond otherwise.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for use in my Mandalorian armor for Star Wars trooping. It's been great for every event, clear to hear, minimal feedback, battery life is great.

My voice would get tired and strained after teaching music classes- and i would worry about my singing gigs. ********The clip fits niceley onbelt or pocket, the battery life is long, i am able to teach 2,  4 hour days without re-charging.

I am in the in-home party industry, and guests at our shows can get a little wild, so having something that allows me to present our products without straining my voice is an absolute plus.The only con is that you do need to get used to your movement when wearing this so you don't cause feedback, but it's not anything that would affect the quality once you know how to avoid it.Absolutely love this voice amp.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was surprised how loud this was and can double up as a speaker for music players.  The headset that it came with worked better, probably because it's directional, than the smaller mic that i had bought to replace it with since I didn't want to use a headset. I would recommend this to a friend.  It will also be fun for costumes.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's clearly not an Apple designed product, but heck, for the price, this thing does what it needs to do. We do walking tours of groups of 12-20 people and this thing does an amazing job getting my voice to the people in back even while standing on the street. Only minor issue is that the headpiece wire that goes behind the head and over the ears is too large (and I have a big head). Overall very good product for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product packing stated 3500sqft coverage.  In reality, it was about 600-700sq ft at most.  It also gives a bit of feedback when turned up all the way.It May be good for talking to a group of 10-20 people near you without raising your voice, but this is quieter than a yell.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought two of these to use for my recent music video shoot. Solid 3 5 stars. It does the job but the headphone construction really reduces the overall value of this thing. My thoughts below:PROS:- Compact, easy to clip on belt, very simple to use- Sound quality is acceptable, I rate it 6.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is small and easy to use. When you turn it up enough to project voice, it often screeches. This makes it unpredictable to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  Durability is not there.  Feedback is shockingly horrible. Overall, I was very disappointed.  If you want to see thirty fourth graders scream and cover their ears due to horrific squealing feedback, this is the product for you.","positive":0},{"review":"  it was used it didn't work.","positive":0},{"review":"  Difficult to get microphone in proper place.Not enough amplification to use in one room much less outside.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the amp itself - easy to operate, clear sound, light weight - but the headset is a major annoyance.  I coud not adjust it to stop falling off.  It did work well when I used it.","positive":0},{"review":"  mic died with very limited use. Hopefully the amp still works. Cheap product I will not buy again. Look elsewhere.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unfortunately am unable to use it becuase of noise feedback at the slightest movement.  Ends up with everyone jumping out of their skins.","positive":0},{"review":"  not loud enough--- better if there were no cords to drag around--but hey, it worked, and it was cheap, blah blah.","positive":0},{"review":"  This voice amplifier works quite well, but it sure ain't cheap. But we decided to go with this one based on the good reviews. Nice and compact though.  But if you have a soft voice and need to crank the volume up on this to be heard, expect to get some squealing feedback often.","positive":1},{"review":"  I volunteer at an assisted living facility once a week and some of the residents are nearly deaf.  I ordered this voice amplifier and it worked perfectly, but was not quite loud enough for the deaf residents.  The 16 watt is probably louder than you would need in normal situations like a classroom, but it has a volume adjustment.  My grandchildren also like to use it to song solos for the family.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased the Aker MR1506 to amplify my speaking voice, which has been decreasing in volume and clarity due to ALS.  It works well to provide added volume (doesn't help clarity), but it is limited by feedback as the volume is increased.  It is very light and easy to wear and the headset is comfortable.  Overall, it meets my needs, but it would meet them much better with less feedback.","positive":1},{"review":"  I never had to turn the volume all the way up to be heard in a crowd by the people close to me. I wasn't trying to be heard by everyone, so this item worked perfectly for my needs. The included microphone pinched my head but was functional without hiss or static, so I won't lessen the review because of my personal preference.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve owned three different wattages of this brand. The 10 watt model is not as clear as the 20 watt, but it is much smaller and  lighter and can be clipped on the waistline of my pants, so that`s why I choose this model. I tried the 16 watt, but still felt it was heavier than I like.","positive":1},{"review":"  I teach Middle School. Last year I used a voice amplifier that cost a little less than this one.  I love it. It saves my voice and my throat.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a tour director in Washington DC.  Many sites in DC are crowded, making it difficult for my groups of 40-50 people to hear the explanation the sites. Great value for the price. I am so glad I purchased it, it's a keeper.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this for my Mandalorian costume where I attend events with plenty of people, and it works great. I`m able to communicate with people easily thanks to the quality of sound. I`ve had it for over a year and have not had to charge it yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  I lost one vocal cord to cancer and my voice is low and I really love the VoiceBooster because people can hear me talk better. I was disappointed because when I went to slip it on my belt the plastic clip broke - I don't know how the manuf.  I was wondering if you would please email me TK Products telephone number because I need to ask them a questions regarding the VoiceBooster - I tried to find their telephone number but couldn't.Thank you for great service.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good audio and durable material.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nothing spectacular about it..This is a rather simple product that does what it is supposed to do pure and simple.Construction feels a bit on the cheap side so I'm not exactly sure about long term durability, but for now, it works.","positive":0},{"review":"  After receiving this and testing, I soon realize I could not use it.  Too much 'squeeking' i., electronic feed back, and the voice sounded tinny and at best, just cacophony.  I had to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Kept echoing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall, this aker Voice Amp was not too bad for normal conversations in a relatively quite room, although I did have some issues with feedback, even though the speaker was in a pouch on my belt.  In a large party type atmosphere, no one could hear me with the amp turned all the way up.  Overall though, not bad for the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  expected more from it. was not very clear all of the time did not work for our needs. thats it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this amp to be heard on the telephone since my voice has gone to a whisper due to cancer, It works ok for aq normal voice but mine is so weak I have to turn the vol. up so hi I get a lot of feedback.","positive":0},{"review":"  My problem with this device is the head set -- it doesn't fit well and is not adjustable.  You have to hold the microphone to keep it positioned correctly in front of your mouth.  Otherwise, it would have been well-suited for my needs.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works well.","positive":0},{"review":"  The devise makes a lot of noise.It is very hard to use.I am so dissatisfied with it. My Doctor had me to get it thinking it would help family hear me better.","positive":0},{"review":"  It makes some terrible noise when try to make it louder, so it only works fine at lower volume levels.","positive":0},{"review":"  I do a lot of public speaking and my voice therapist urged me to use this speaker.  It is smaller and lighter than older models.  Aker promptly sent a replacement no charge.  A very good product for those who need to be heard and who need to protect their voice.","positive":1},{"review":"  Speaker is great. Loud and clear. I use it with my storm trooper armor.","positive":1},{"review":"  We are a historical society, and have found the Aker Voice Amplifier very helpful for addressing tour groups (outside) and audiences at presentations (inside). No more complaints from the back of the crowd, \"We can't hear you. but with a little practice this is easy to avoid. We were also very pleased with the fast shipping.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this with a TKTalkie for my 501st Stormtrooper.  It's wonderful.  Lasts all day and it's plenty loud. Plus it's tiny.","positive":1},{"review":"  All I can say is that I have heard these were great PAs and I know many cosplayers use them with Storm Trooper outfits.  I ordered one and once I got everything hooked up I thought I was having a block party.  This little PA will wake up the neighborhood very quickly, so be careful when you turn it on for the first time. I love it and can't wait to use it in a public setting.","positive":1},{"review":"  The product is of high quality. The shipping was fast and the product was in excellent condition.Everything came very well, I really liked it is excellentI recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very nice just what I needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this on 501st events and it hasn't let me down yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  This amp arrived quickly, so I've got no complaints on the shipping time.  The price is also VERY reasonable for what you're getting..So if you're in the market for a really good, compact, light weight, & LOUD voice amp, BUY WITH CONFIDENCE.","positive":1},{"review":"  This equipment is very good for teachers. It makes your voice louder without stress your vocal cords.The sound is clear and the it has a good size.It's very comfortable to use it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product would have been so great, had it not given constant feedback.  Not useable  :(  I would not suggest this item.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for an 85 yr. old lady who has a very low voice.  If you turn it up, it squeals.","positive":0},{"review":"  The voicebooster sqelches loudly when mic gets close to unit, very easy to do even with the purchase of the tie clip mic. I wasted my money.","positive":0},{"review":"  It arrived timely and I thought it was just what I wanted but then found you needed 220 electric to charge it.  I returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm a teacher and this amplifier was just what I needed to save my voice.  I use it everyday. and the students can hear me over all the outside noises.  Works really well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this item for a person with Parkinson's disease. One of the characteristics of Parkinson's is that you lose your volume after a while and you get quieter and quieter. I think a clip on mic would be better. Otherwise, we're pretty satisfied with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought it for a person with Parkinson's  whose voice is very soft and hard to hear and understand.  The amplifier makes a huge difference:  helps with the stress of having to repeat and repeat and with the satisfaction of being able to do something about it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a fabulous product. Super loud and works just what I need it for. I bought it for talking during meetings because I can't project my voice much as I have a vocal cord polyp and am instructed by my Speech Therapist to talk at a lower volume, so this works wonders in amplifying my voice. It may be a bit pricey, but it's great quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for a wireless microphone that allows me to do a Qigong session or Power Point Presentations with a small group of people inside. For this purpose the Aker Voice Amplifier works great: people could hear me clearly, I could move around. still it felt uncomfortable. For outside use it's to weak.","positive":1},{"review":"  This will work perfectly for teaching my 31 (sometimes loud) 3rd graders. I love that I can clip it on easily. Highly recommended for teachers..","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been using Voice Boosters for several years.  They are good for walking tours- just enough voice amplification for a group of 15 to 20 persons.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very good sound projection.","positive":1},{"review":"  The little device performs well, but our band director experienced feed back when the wire between the headset and the amplifier brushed against the music stand.  She had better luck putting the wire behind her shoulder and bring it through her belt loop to the amplifier.  The Aker system works well enough however that she wants the band to keep it for times when there is no electricity available and for a general backup.  Having her voice amplified definitely helped the band rehearsals go more smoothly.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great little device.  Just gradually increase the volume and you won't get any feedback.  We live alongside a busy street and to test it out, my husband walked over next to that noisy traffic side of the fence.  I could hear him even at a whisper.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very pleased with this item: the sound quality is excellent and everything is working: no batteries have to be sought and no  ample instructions have to be read: very user friendly. Only thing I would have liked as an extra would be a clip for the mike.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got it for a 82 yr old friend so she could use it with a hard of hearing friend.  Works great, but she forgets to use it.  I wish she'd use it with me, but I forget she has it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Used it for outdoor purposes. Holds a charge pretty darn well. Tried using an external mic and it just hummed. Not sure why, but it just works best with the given headset.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent voice booster. Voice comes out loud and clear. Pair this bad boy up with the TK products iComm device for all of your trooping needs..","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased these for members of our readers group to use during public performances.  These work great.  They have good amplification and are very easy to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  This products helps me to be heard when no other sound system is available. For the price you can't go wrong. Could use a less cumbersome microphone. I recommend the product but a more elegant microphone.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very good product, I like it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a perfect low cost alternative to losing your voice. My students think I'm a rock star and really pay better attention when I have this in use. It saves my voice and is so easy to use and charge. Works perfectly with my ipod, too.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great for teachers.","positive":1},{"review":"  A good product.  Clear sound.  It needs either a slightly roomier box or an addition to the instructions on how to repack for storage.  Better yet, both.","positive":1},{"review":"  small, fits where it needs to , loud, thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  Due to surgery 12 months ago, i could rarely be heard,,  Now i can talk..and be heard,,,,,,,love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excelant.  this is a great voice amp.

It can be exceptionally loud and comes with a great light headset.  It also comes with a nice pouch and a pretty large strap to hook it to yourself.","positive":1},{"review":"  The AVA is great for costuming, the main reason I purchased it, especially when you need to have a conversation in a very noisy environment. Battery life is good and the headset is comfortable enough that you can forget you're wearing it.","positive":1},{"review":"  does just what I needed for an outside class of Tai chi.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a teacher and got laryngitis.  This little device saved the day.  I plan to continue to use it, it saves the voice and the kids listen when it is on.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works wonder on the floor in My Mandalorian armor.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was not looking for high quality sound, I just needed to save my singing voice. I use it when I'm directing plays, running large rehearsals, or leading activities at assisted living facilities.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this for a security job, and have a ballistic faceplate that makes me difficult to hear my voice clearly. Since buying this, it's worked very well in being heard on the street when necessary. I can be clearly heard in very busy, crowded areas, and the boom mic stays firmly in place.","positive":1},{"review":"  precioso a mi esposa le encanto sin plabras, tremendo se los recomiendo este sin mas nada q decir me despido.","positive":1},{"review":"  My husband's voice has weakened over the years. This was just what my husband needed to give a presentation on Veteran's Day.

I put clips on speaker strap for quick removal (should be included).","positive":1},{"review":"  I give ghost walk tours and this mic is wonderful.

Love the way you charge it instead of using batteries.","positive":1},{"review":"  One of the best and most reliable options for voice amplification--ran it through its paces at an event with over 7,000 people, and it performed flawlessly.

I have not tested the battery life but it was used for many hours without needing to recharge (Comes with built in rechargeable battery) as the day went by.This is a recommended purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  As a teacher, this has saved my voice.  I use it four hours a day, four days a week on average.  However, being a thin person, it doesn't actually cinch tight enough to sit comfortably around my waist.  I also had to have a handy friend put some crinks in the headset wire to make it fit around my head.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a class of 31 first graders this year and was tired of clapping or raising my voice to get their attention everytime.  I saw another teacher using something like this and thought why not.

It does what I expected it to do.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wish I would have had this device 11 years ago when I started teaching High School Biology.

Great for what I do use it for.","positive":1},{"review":"  I spent a lot of time reading through reviews before purchasing. I was fairly certain that this laptop would be too slow for gaming, but fast enough to stream a movie or watch a DVD or youtube videos.

I've always been a fan of Chromebooks and anxiously anticipated upgrading to this work of art (and it really is beautiful).  If, however, performance is at all a concern and you plan to do some work or moderate play, I would opt for the X360. Both are wonderful machines in their own right and it's a pleasure to see the evolution of the Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Asus Flip 434 is my first venture into Chrome. It's my first ever laptop notebook computer as well. It's almost if you know how to surf the web you can use a Chromebook or Box.

The chamfered shiny edges are a nice touch without being too flashy.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I would buy it again.  The only real issue I see is the potential to lose a mircoSD card.","positive":1},{"review":"  After using it for a few days, I have to say that the fashion looking Asus C434 keyboard is a little unpleasant. Under sunlight, it is hard to distinguish the white letters from silver backgrounds. I would rather have a black keyboard with white letters like the old C302 ones or MacBooks, it looks more professional and more beautiful for me. Besides that, an impressive Netbook with a lot of new designs especially the narrow bezel screen, still highly recommended for anyone who in love with Chrome OS.","positive":1},{"review":"  First Chromebook I've owned and I'm really enjoying it so far. I opted for the 8gb model for a little future proofing.The cons don't justify not buying this chromebook imo. If you want a mid+ level chromebook that punches up in build quality, style, and performance, then you can't go wrong here.","positive":1},{"review":"  I haunted the Asus and Amazon websites waiting for the right oppotunity to grab the 8gb 64gb version of this chromebook.  I really wanted the 8gb 128gb version, but I can't find that anywhere and Amazon seems to be the only vendor selling this chromebook with 8gb ram.  And, at the end of the day, I'm glad I bought it (mostly .-)  ).","positive":1},{"review":"  Update May 30, 2020  You must read comments regarding Auto Screen Rotate.

Overall very happy with the ASUS Chromebook Flip C434TA-DSM4T, here are my thoughts. The perfect Asus C434. Install the C302 keyboard, boost screen resolution, offer a sleeve specific to the C434's dims, and maybe move up to a more powerful processor just to give it extra horsepower.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this chrome book.  I am more amazed by the Chrome OS as it can do a lot more than I ever expected..  login with my Google login and it's as if I never lost a step.","positive":1},{"review":"  I returned this in frustration. The advertised \"Super Bright\" keyboard was NOT bright at all. Even with the backlight turned off, the tiny font of the keys combined with the metallic reflective surface of the keys makes it still hard to read. It makes the beautiful small bezel screen irrelevant.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is supposed to be the successor to the excellent C302 but it falls short. The thin bezel screen is beautiful and lovely. Other than this, the construction feels solid and the dimensions are nice. I wanted to like this but I much prefer my C302 and will be selling this.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received the Chromebook in a timely manner as promised. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned from the start.But I should mention that when unpacking the unit from the box, there was things about the inner packagingthat made me suspicious that it wasn't original packing from the factory but rather, a repackaged item.No way to know for sure.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was my original review.. The only drawback is that the keyboard should be brighter during the day, sometimes the letters are hard to see in daylight. but otherwise I am very happy with this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  This review was originally only for the first unit I received. I have since been sent two replacements which had issues as well.Heed the negative reviews\u2014the quality control really is as bad as they make it sound. Unless you're okay with trying until you get one that isn't a lemon (and praying that nothing fails down the road), you might want to look elsewhere.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had issues right from the start with it. When I hit the number 1, it would type 13428709. Worked with their support who was helpful but took a lot of time to get exactly where I got in less time.

I did this and still have had issues.Hope this helps people in the search.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was extremely excited to receive this Chromebook. My wife has had hers for a couple weeks and it works great. Long time customer disappointed. .","positive":0},{"review":"  I waited to buy this.  Purchased as soon as Amazon had them in stock.  I reached out to Asus and it will take more than two weeks for them to repair it.  Do yourself a favor and get something other than this Chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  Update - recieved 3rd unit, first thing I tried was bluetooth and it failed. Called Amazon support AND ASUS support. Very disappointed ASUS. Hoping someone there pays attention.","positive":0},{"review":"  After reading all of the reviews, I was a little worried placing my order for this laptop. I spent days and days watching and reading all types of reviews. It's amazing how small the laptop is, yet it's still a 14 inch screen. I love this new little device, and I will make sure to update my review if I run into any problems in the future.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought 2 of these Chromebooks almost 6 months ago for my wife and my Mom.  I am happy to say that they have not been a disappointment. When disconnected from the net, they are still very quick offline.  I would recommend these as a great , moderately priced tablet for those folks that do not need a top of the line award.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this chromebook for three weeks now, and I have used it on a constant daily basis of about 8-10 hours per day. I am impressed by the build quality and usability.DR: I highly recommend this Chromebook to power users of Chrome. It's features and build quality are well worth the higher price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Before I even begin this review let's get to the downsides of this thing. The keyboard backlighing isn't all that bright which is bad when you're trying to use the keyboard and you can't see the keys and the weight of this thing in tablet mode is insane. It's sturdy, light enough to carry with me and most importantly it handles everything I can throw at it and doesn't complain. If you're looking for a good Chromebook this is the one you should get.","positive":1},{"review":"  The memory is 4 GB and over 3 appears to be used.  I don't stress the system so it works for me.  Just checked and the sd is not working again - annoying.Took off one star for the sd poor design.","positive":1},{"review":"  Using this machine for the last few days.  Just wanted to add to the reviews already present on Amazon.  Widescreen vs 3:2 aspect ratio.  Both have good build quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  I own a dozen Chromebooks, including the Google Pixel, and the Asus out-performs all of them by every measure. The aluminium build is better than the Acer 14 that was popular for a long time, the battery life is better than the the smaller Acers and the practical screen-size and cost make it a better option than the famed Google Pixel. I've used this now for nearly two months and it's a just a spectacular device. If you're considering a great all-round Chromebook with a solid build quality at a mid-point price, look no further.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this because it it as modern version of my ancient Toshiba Chromebook 2 that I also love. The key travel and keyboard are much the same except this has the plenty bright when you adjust up keyboard lighting. Not trying to review the Toshiba here as I did that 5 years ago and it still being used. Just making the comparisons in my case.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'd like a screen with somewhat higher pixel density, but it is nice and pretty sharp. I'd like a bit more horsepower, but it's a $600 Linux laptop with really good Chrome support.Overall, I'm very happy with this machine. It's a fast Chromebook that can run Linux apps (and or terminal) in a window or full-screen.","positive":1},{"review":"  The GoodI mostly really like this machine -- it's fast, the touchscreen is fun for playing games.It's light and looks like a much more expensive machine.In sum: I wanted to be in love with this machine. Its still very good, but there's more to dislike than you'll read about in the tech press, which fawns over this thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a pretty big fan of Chromebooks, with five of them in house for the family. I picked the Asus up because I'm generally happy with their products and I was looking for a CB with an Intel chipset. Yeah. The Intel chipset is really what got me, along with the multi-form capability (traditional, tablet - which it's too heavy to hold comfortable - and hybrid) but I would rather have picked something else, especially knowing that as a tablet, it's too heavy and as a traditional keyboard screen the keyboard just isn't great.","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all, I will address the keyboard. Like many others have said, out of the box, it is unreadable in bright ambient light. Otherwise, it appears to go into a standby type mode that kills the battery. So wait 10 seconds or so before closing the lid after shutdown.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased two of these units for our kids to use at school thanks to the strong recommendation of the Wirecutter. Unfortunately, one of the devices was a lemon with an entire keyboard row not responding to input. Not ASUS, who demands the buyer purchase a $15 shipping label and wait weeks for repair.Not a company I will do business with again.","positive":0},{"review":"  My problems may have been specific to my computer (at least that's what I'm hoping. my exchange is in progress). the touch screen goes all the way to the very edges so when I adjusted the screen tilt I often thumbed something and would have to undo whatever it was my thumbs changed.  I will edit this review once I've had my replacement for a bit.","positive":0},{"review":"  Wanted to love this one- it's highly rated by tech reviewers.  A bit high priced for a Chromebook, but I hoped to get what I paid for.  Who knows if this was due to poor design, quality control, or the horrible packaging by the shipper (zero padding around the computer.)  Hopefully this defect is the exception and not the rule.","positive":0},{"review":"  Let's get the good things out of the way. The physical aesthetic design of C434 is without a doubt, the prettiest chromebook I have ever held. Unappealing, but livable. Dirty screen effect, not so much.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Coming from a Samsung Chromebook Pro, this feels leaps and bounds more durable sturdy. Backlit keys are bright, the speakers are absurdly loud at half volume it was a competition with my television. \"Regarding the backlit keyboard, it is recommended to turn it off while working in a well illuminated room or area\" That statement is akin to a car manufacturer stating, \"While our paint choice of chrome may hurt some individuals eyes, it is recommended to wear sunglasses when stepping outside the vehicle\"Something I have encountered, (which Inhave attached a video of) is random BLACK VERTICAL lines. They do not stay, just a brief flicker, moreover, they do not occur in the same area of the screen.","positive":0},{"review":"  Let's start by saying that the Asus looks great. It's sleek, the keyboard feels great, screen is crisp and bright, and the battery lasts for 8 hours. Any torque applied from the side runs the risk of causing the machine to hard lock (hold down power for 30s to force a restart)This is a bit disappointing considering that the last chromebook didn't suffer those problems, so I don't believe this to be a chromeos problem. Since this is a travel machine for work, these are just annoying bugs rather than hard fails, but it would be really nice if I didn't have to deal with them.","positive":0},{"review":"  The aluminum body and slim bezels on this Chromebook are great.  But at 3.  With the default display settings, many images on websites looked blurry and low quality, including all of the icons within Gmail.  Because of these issues, I ended up returning the laptop and ordering an Asus C302CA-DHM4 instead, which is significantly lighter and doesn't appear to have the same keyboard label issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  ..We like Asus products here and have two other Asus chromebooks along with a Samsung Pro, HP 13, a Toshiba, and A Google Pixelbook. I was looking forward to this one's speed and fine build so this is quite a disappointment.","positive":0},{"review":"  REEAAAALLLLLYYYYY like this one.  I'm a veteran of a LOT of laptops over many years, both from work and personal.  I can't say that about many of the laptops I've used previously.Just overall a really nice piece of hardware, that runs Chrome OS perfectly, and it looks good doing it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I researched the heck out of these chromebooks before buying this one.  This was my first one of these and I was concerned that it would be cheaply made or be less useful than the higher end laptops I've been buying for years.  Really good customer experience, great product at a fair price.  I will never buy another laptop again (and goodbye forever to Windows and OS).","positive":1},{"review":"  My new ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 replaced a Chromebook purchased in 2013.

Actually, I am very pleasantly surprised at the value and options for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Afte purchasing the Chromebook Pixel in 2015 for years I did not feel any urge to replace it. it just did everything fine, no complaints up till today, at all. turning down illumination in bright spaces helps - but this is definitevely worse, than on the Chromebook Pixel 2015.All together: I have found a good replacement for my Chromebook Pixel 2015, stylish, real workhorse, tablet mode -and at an very exceptable price.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm not completely new to Chromebooks, my Children both use them for school and I've messed around with them off and on for a couple of years.  Recently my 10 year old Macbook's battery finally gave up and I found myself in the market for a new laptop.  Getting offline work (or playing) done without a always on internet connection is entirely possible with minimal planning in advance.  In my humble opinion using a Chromebook without the internet connection is just as doable as working with any Windows or Mac based product when you are offline.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m not a tech person so bear with me on this review..ConsSpeakers on the bottom, slightly muffle the sound unless you flip it.Battery life slightly diminished after 6 months of regular useSometimes dropped WiFi signal for a couple seconds and needs to reconnectProsSpeakers are lOudExcellent battery lifeTouch screen works greatNice keyboardVery fast loading webpages, streaming, etc.","positive":1},{"review":"  I consider myself an expert on computers, and save for the keyboard backlighting, I like pretty much everything about it. Bought for kindergartener.The problem, like other reviewer`s have stated, is that when ambient light, or light from the screen, reflects off the shiny silver keyboard, the inadequately designed back lighting system can`t compete. Once you turn the brightness up on the keyboard (alt +screen brightness up) it becomes a bit more usable, but I have overhead lighting turned on for my daughter which remedies the floor I have overhead lighting turned on for my daughter, which remedies the flaw.","positive":1},{"review":"  The first chromebook I got had some sort of weird water spots on the screen, but amazon was quick to offer a replacement or full refund.  I chose the replacement, because I really wanted the chromebook.Overall, a great little chromebook.  I have found no issues yet, but I will update if I find any.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love chromebooks. I just need a computer for the basics like online shopping, writing, the occasional Netflix stream, etc so I don't need anything too fancy. I also know very little about computer specs so I can't really say much in that. I just wanted a little upgrade from my previous chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this Chromebook.  All aluminum body and a fantastic display - nice and bright and crisp, videos look amazing.  I completely disagree, as a Chromebook doesn't need a lot of memory to perform well - and this device is blazing fast - a lot faster than my 8gb Windows 10 HP laptop.  I am really enjoying this device, and if you have an Android phone, this is the laptop to get - its part of the Google ecosystem.","positive":1},{"review":"  I finally decided to replace my aging toshiba Chromebook that has been a solid performer for many years. I read a bunch of reviews and the Asus c434 Chromebook consistently came up as a recommended mid range laptop. I have managed to get a partial refund from Amazon (Yeah Amazon for standing up and doing at least that.) I will be taking my money and running away from Asus as fast as i can.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased the C434 to replace a Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 - that barely lasted a year when one of the hinges decided to become stuck in the permanently closed position and shattered the screen when I opened it. I loved the Samsung CB Plus V2. I have had t-shirts come with more padding than what they shipped this thing with.Pretty disappointed all around.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have been a fan of Asus products for a long time and I truly wanted to love this chromebook but in the end the frustration of using it has made me rethink buying from Asus ever again.  Lets start with what I do like.. I wanted so much to love this.","positive":0},{"review":"  Screen quality is good Speed is fast biggest complaint is lousy wi-fi connection. My router is in other room less then 25 ft away but this Asus always loses connection or tells me I have medium connection. Seems this Asus is a lemon too. Would only recommend if using right in front of your modem or router or direct connection via hard wire.","positive":0},{"review":"  July 16 I had a problem right out of the box when the machine wouldn't turn on. I got that sorted out and it's fine...","positive":0},{"review":"  I was an early adopter of this computer. Chrome OS has come a long way and it now provides a fantastic alternative to Windows and Macs. I feel that ASUS has done a HUGE disservice in releasing this computer with two significant functional issues that anyone in their testing organization should have found within a few hours at most.Maybe later versions don't have these issues.","positive":0},{"review":"  The computer itself is great.  Wonderful screen, good size, lightweight, long battery life, very quick recharge.

It is delightful to type on but in many lighting situations the lettering is pretty much invisible. If you don't want to bite the big bullet and buy a Pixel I believe you will be happy with this. My I-7 XPS 13 spends weeks at a time with little use except for the rare occasion when I have to do something that isn't browser or Android app based.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a slight shift from my HP Pavillion (which is over 5 years old and runs VERY slow - 5 solid mins to power up) and I finally decided to buy this after months of contemplating. The keyboard, like most reviews mentioned, is a little hard to read, during the day and night, so I purchased a separate keyboard cover (any 14\" that fits Chromebook will do - doesn't have to be specifically for ASUS C434 - but this also makes 1) the keys a lot harder to type 2) very dim or no backlight which is fine since I usually use this during the day and under some sort of lighting. Also love the flip design and thin bezels so I can watch movies and TV shows. Also super fast and efficient for a person who has fifty tabs open at once and runs very smoothly.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is true that whoever designed the backlighting has made this great Chromebook horribly awkward to use in most lighting conditions. HOWEVER, you can easily adjust this, and give you a \"normal\" keyboard.. so if that is making you think twice, know that you can counteract it easily.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love it.Another poster has gone into detail and all i can say is ditto. Smile.Luckily I have a lot of experience with multiple devices and diferent keyboards so a couple of days of touch-typing i never looked back.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice build quality, good amount of RAM and memory.  My last Chromebook was going strong after 6 years so I expect this one will last that long too.  Since I purchased this there have been products introduced by both Microsoft and Apple that seem decent for the money.  But this is a computer I use for non-work non-business, so it is a big advantage to not have to deal with software updates and configuration ( it is automatic ).","positive":1},{"review":"  Great performance. I also use an i7 Pixelbook and thought the c434 would be far less performant, but it supports my typescript workflow well enough. I get it that for aesthetic reasons manufacturers will use non black keycaps but I have yet to see a non black keyboard work well with a backlight.Great value when you can get it on sale.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have used a previous version of the Asus Chromebook Flip for many years and have been very happy with the quality, reliability and usability of it.  When I received notification that my old chromebook would no longer receive updates from Google, I decided to look at new Chromebook models.  It is slim enough to make it easy to carry and travel with.  I am happy with my decision and would recommend this model to anyone looking for a quality Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my second Asus Chromebook Flip. I had a smaller, older model, but wanted to replace my Linux laptop entirely with a Chromebook and wanted a bigger screen, more memory, and faster processor. Together, they are my constant companions. Very happy camper.","positive":1},{"review":"  I loved everything about this machine except the keyboard as others have said. The problem for me is the light letters on light keys. I had to return this machine for this reason. If you don't need to see what keys you are hitting, this is the one to have.","positive":1},{"review":"  As you know, it takes awhile to get used to a new computer- especially if you're switching out from a mac PC to chrome. That being said, the transition has been quite easy and so far (I've had it about 20 days) I absolutely love working with this computer. if that happens I will indeed update, but so far I really enjoy this laptop and have no issues whatsoever. It's fast, easy to use, has a long battery life, light, and looks good overall.","positive":1},{"review":"  The chromebook is like a Time Share, to fully use the services offered there will be a monthly fee after you spend money on the tablet itself.  For Me It is not worth spending money on a premium tablet just to have google force sell me additional services.  I really like the design, but conversion from other media platforms to chromebook costs to much time.  I think Google has missed the mark.","positive":0},{"review":"  So I got the Asus c434 about a month ago. The screen flickers quite a bit lately. Unforcunately I'm past my 30 days on amazon and there is no option to return it. Im hoping to figure out a way to return it and get the google pixel book go.","positive":0},{"review":"  A month after I started using the laptop, I noticed the screen would sometimes flicker black in the mid-section of the screen. I talked to customer service and followed their every step none of which helped. Staying in a queue on the phone forever, being told to turn to reset it and to ship it halfway cross the world is not what I had in mind and not at all how Ive been treated by other laptop companies previously. Disappointing.","positive":0},{"review":"  We were excited to open the brand new Chromebook.  It looked great, and the good news is that most of the keys on the keyboard worked.  They won't send a new one out.  I guess you get what you pay for.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for my daughter going off to college. It worked fine for about 10 months, then stopped taking a charge and went dead for no apparent reason.For a $200 chromebook, I would say you get what you pay for, but it was $560. Just awful.","positive":0},{"review":"  The bluetooth doesn't work at all on the ASUS C434T. I tried connecting to several different devices and had the same issue- as soon as the device paired it disconnected from bluetooth, After several calls with an Amazon representative and then with an Asus  representative, it was determined that it was a hardware issue with the device. It is literally impossible to connect a device through bluetooth. Stay away.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've used this computer for 9 months now. A huge flaw is the Micro SD card port. Hopefully once its returned to me, they'll have fixed it and it works. For now, no computer for 3 weeks while its shipped, fixed, and shipped back.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product worked for a few days very nicely but charging failed and the Chromebook is simply dead. Had to return and purchase a new Chromebook. Upgrade is expected Tuesday.

THere is not pattern.  So after two out of the box failures Im done with ASUS.","positive":0},{"review":"  The Chromebook completed died one day out of the blue after owning it for less than 8 months.

It was excellent but the battery life was just ok..  I seldom use my desktop now.","positive":1},{"review":"  Using this computer to type this review right now.  I initially wanted another Windows tablet, but I live off Google suites.  Looks sleek with a fast start up.  If you're looking for a computer for everyday work, or even college courses, this is it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have not had this Chromebook long enough to review anything other than functionality.  I really like all of the features.  My experience in general is it appears computer companies have decided to the let the customers perform the \"burn-in\" for the computers and let \"infant mortality\" happen in the hands of the end user vs. being part of the manufacture process.","positive":1},{"review":"  My chromebook so far is working well i woulld just like it much better if the volume sound of speakers was higher.  Sometimes the volume is at it's fullest and I still cannot hear as clearly and loudly as I would like.Also, when I flip the chromebook, sometimes I have to reflip to get the display function options on again.For the price I believe the speakers could be better quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this Chromebook since January 2020 and wait a while to white my review until now to test how well can I transition myself to Chomebook.

It is replacing a Samsung Plus 2, which had a plastic case. It does allow a 14\" screen in a 13\" space, but it is too easy to touch the edge of the screen, especially in tablet mode.  Otherwise, I can't find anything to complain about.","positive":1},{"review":"  Quality chromebooks are an outstanding computing value. This is one of them.Fast, well made, materially better security than most consumer systems.This is a winner in every regard.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have bought a new Chromebook every year for the last 5 years.

Plays very nice with my Nokia 7.2 and I use the smart-lock feature on the phone to unlock the Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  Frustrated at how often the touch screen functionality freezes and then i have to reboot in order to get the touch screen to work again. Also, when the underside of the keyboard gets held with one hand, it triggers some keyboard shortcuts that change things on the screen.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have heard a lot about getting ones that just have constant problems, but this was after I bought mine when a lot of the reviews were pretty good.  I like the the C434 Chromebook, but mine has come with a lot of repeat issues.  I hope this review helps, do not let it tell you not to buy the c434, but understand multiple ppl have had similar issues, while I have also read that many other ppl have had great experiences.  Good luck.","positive":0},{"review":"  At first I was impressed and hardware is nice, however I began to notice some simple things in my every day computing world was not available on this Chromebook.First..I have chosen another chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  OVERALL THIS IS A QUALITY LAPTOP AND I THINK ANYONE WOULD LOVE IT HAD THEY USED A LITTLE SENSE IN THE LIGHTED KEYBOARD.

WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IF THEY WERE TO RE-DO THEIR BAD KEYBOARD.","positive":0},{"review":"  The screen is great. Truly outstanding quality for streaming moviesBut the keyboard is virtually invisible making typing ridiculously difficult and error prone.I regret the purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  Everything about this Chromebook is fine, or even better.  Except the WIFI.  I have several Chromebooks, from entry level(Acer R11) to premium(Pixelbook), and this has BY FAR, the worst WIFI connectivity of any of them.  If you have a chance to get a similarly or even less expensive,  similarly featured, HP Chromebook x360 14-14\" FHD Touch - Core i3-8130u - 8GB - 64GB eMMC,  that is frequently on sale here or elsewhere, I'd strongly recommend that chromebook over this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  The computer works pretty well, but the touchscreen randomly stops working. There isn't really a point to having a 2 in 1 device if it can't be used in tablet mode.","positive":0},{"review":"  I waited too long to report my flickering screen problem to the seller of this device. You get 30 days for free return to seller, then after that you must ship to manufacturer for repair.. So I get to powerwash the device again, lose a few more weeks' time, and then try again to see if they did or did not fix the problem.","positive":0},{"review":"  Beautiful computer and wonderful small beveled screen for price. However, experienced glitches within the first month and returned it because I was worried about it getting worse in the future. Other than that I loved the screen, ability to run google apps, and keyboard.","positive":0},{"review":"  Solidly built, great look, BUT.. Ironically, I had to restart right in the middle of this review. I am returning it in favor of the Acer Spin 13.","positive":0},{"review":"  Really good Laptop the quality is excellent the touchscreen is good though kind of takes getting used to at the beginning the screen is the biggest perk. The only critique is that the speaker is kind of weak, not the worst sounding but definitely not the best. Overall a bang for your buck. Best chrome I've ever owned and I've bought quite a few.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my first Chromebook, but it's fast. Screen is very nice, although I'm returning it for a couple of reasons. I really wanted a laptop I don't even need a mouse for, but this trackpad sucks. That was the main thing I wanted in my chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far I`m really liking this chrome laptop.  It`s been a learning curve from the traditional desktop and our older laptop.I`m very simple when it comes to electronics so I can`t offer any specs etc, but it operates fast and picture quality is really nice. Price point on this is excellent too.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an absolutely beautiful machine. For those of you, like me, who are sick of Windows laptops that crap out after 18 months, and don't want to pay $2,000 for a Mac, this is the right laptop for you.  Alt + Brightness Down button.This could have been a 5-star review if not for the small chip located on my ALT key right out of the box.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros: I like how the screen folds so you can stand it up in a \"V\". The touch screen is always a plus and the keys of the keyboard are easy to use. Cons: The keyboard is such that the backlit keys are difficult to see in the dark because the keyboard is silver instead of black, but I just purchased a silicone cover in black which says it allows the backlite to shine through, so we'll see how it works. And when the computer is being used as a tablet I haven't figured out how to use the touch screen like you would a mouse when choosing the emoticons on the \"like\" feature on Facebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  I REALLY wish the keys were black, even though they are backlit, it is a worthless feature if you still can't see the keys. With my evening lamp on the symbols blend perfectly with the keys so that it looks like a faceless button. Other than that I really like it, I've never had a chromebook so still learning.","positive":1},{"review":"  great Chromebook but 4 weeks into it the screen is acting sporadically ,constantly jumpy ,flickering,with random webb pages just poping up over what iam looking at  .Iam not sure what the problem is but it has one.it was a malware virus.Elimanated the bad apps and now it's all beautiful again\ud83d\ude42.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer is awesome. The screen is beautiful and responsive, the volume is great, the brightness is great, and I love the ability to freak people out by turning the keyboard all the way around. True, the backlit solution doesn't work that great and the white letters are hard to see against the nearly white grey keys. But the feel and feedback of the keyboard itself is amazing.","positive":1},{"review":"  I will start with who I am because it could help you make your decision. I didn't go to school for anything, yet I own a very web tech related company.When you register it for the warranty with Asus you have to select the commercial NB product type. Apparently this is the company level netbook.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like the feel of this Chromebook. It has a very sturdy & solid feel to it. When I use this on my lap or a soft surface I'll end up using earbuds or headphones.Overall a decent device at this price point.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros:Excellent build qualityThin screen bezelsFairly bright screenBacklit keyboardCons:While the screen is bright, text isn`t as sharp as you`d expect at this priceBacklit keyboard is nice but makes it difficult to read because the keys are silver instead of black.Overall I feel if this were priced at 400-450 it would be a great value. I expect more at 599.","positive":0},{"review":"  Open box deal advertised as \"damaged packaging\" only but the item arrived with a broken screen. The display was peeling away from the chassis, which is a pretty bad defect for a 2-in-1. But dual booting into Linux (with Crouton) was a bit taxing and I couldn't get Linux-compatible games to launch via Steam. A bit disappointing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved my new Chromebook initially, but after a long flight I was never able to get power to the screen again - after an hour on the phone with Amazon tech support and another hour with ASUS tech support, ASUS advised that I send it back. Not sure that I will reorder.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unfortunately zero stars from me on this one -  bought this for my daughter who is in Grade 4, to help her with her virtual classes. Went by product reviews that it is one of the best for students - however my daughter kept getting kicked out of zoom meetings at least 15 times a day , pages and videos took over 5-7 mnts to load and she ended up missing many lessons because of the laptop. It`s just this chrome book. Not sure if I got a bad piece but there is no way I can recommend this.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is about a month since I purchased this laptop for my daughter.  Everyone is rushing to buy one for their kid due to COVID-19 remote learning this fall. Anyway, I kept it because there is a shortage of laptops and I am in a bind so as long as the laptop works, and it is a great laptop, by the way, I guess we`ll chug along.  But Amazon shipping messed up.","positive":0},{"review":"  I read review after review on this laptop before purchasing and not one told me how bad the volume is. My cell phone volume is louder at half volume. My husband \u2018s iPad is louder. Very disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am returning this laptop after using it for 3 weeks b c I am disappointed with the lack of clarity during video conferencing and the inability to increase the volume. Unfortunately, I didn't understand how important pixels were to visual clarity and how much variance there is between laptops. I am returning this laptop and getting my Surface Pro 4 refurbished for the same price I paid for this laptop. My second option would have been getting a refurbished IPad Pro which has great visual clarity and is a touch screen.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very sleek size, clean and minimal. Performance is great. It causes a screen glitch out when in contact with any metal. This seems irreversible.","positive":0},{"review":"  DOA, Dead on ARRIVAL with attached message Missing chrome os.. I have to return for refund. It seems Asus did not know this issue and their tech service has no idea of what this about.","positive":0},{"review":"  My 6 year old Asus laptop hard drive took a dump so I purchased this gorgeous 2 in 1 as a replacement.  I hesitated BIG TIME because of a non-feature common to both laptops.  Asus blew a great opportunity to create a frigging awesome Chromebook.  Either problem noted was enough for me to return this beautiful Book.","positive":0},{"review":"  For the money the screen quality, keyboard feel, speed, and build quality are all great, but there are two flaws that keep me from giving a full 5 stars.  The keyboard backlight coupled with the silver keys make it difficult to see key letters in the day time.  The other flaw is that the laptop is actually uncomfortable to place on your lap because of the hinge design.  There are some uncomfortable edges and protrusions that make it so I would only use it on a desktop for extended periods of time.","positive":1},{"review":"  First chromebook after having bought many other personal computers in my long life.  I wanted this to run specific Android apps, which it does brilliantly.  I also enjoy watching movies, using the touch screen, typing on the back lit keyboard and connecting devices using the USB-A port and dual USB-C ports.  Speed, battery life and features have totaled up to much more than I expected.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I picked up this chromebook a few weeks ago, first time owning one, after years of laptops.  Not being the most technically adept person in the world, I needed something to handle mail, personal budget forecasting, browsing, Google Photos, and not much more.So am I getting my moneys worth.  You bet.","positive":1},{"review":"  ChromeOS has come a long way, and this hardware exemplify the perfect blend: enough performance, memory, storage, not too big, not too small all at a very reasonable price. And now that ChromeOS (has for a while) supports Android apps, and Linux (including apps), I'm not sure the 2-4x cost of either a bloatware infected Windows (where the bloatware will soon be swapped for virus infections) machine or an over-priced locked-in ecosystem MacBook is worth it. I switched long-time ago from Windows to Mac, but have been disappointed with Apple's progress and switched to this Chromebook. I have been pleasantly surprised.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very nice in most ways, so it is hard to understand how they failed so miserably with keyboard backlight design.  In most lighting conditions it makes the keys less visible rather than more. The easy solution is to just turn off the backlight -- it is just a nuisance to do so every time one boots up.  FYI -- backlight brightness is controlled by alt screen brightness buttons.","positive":1},{"review":"  I REALLY like Chromebooks and won`t be without one anymore. My mother`s iPad was old and not receiving updates, so I gave her my old Asus Chromebook and shopped around for a new one for myself. I really wanted another flip Chromebook, but I loved the lighted keys on my MacBook Pro, so I only looked for Chromebooks with lighted keys. This Asus C434T checked off all the boxes for what I wanted, and it`s fast and of excellent build quality, all at a good price for a premium Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a tiny bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong it's still a beautiful machine, but I've encountered a problem within 2 days of using it. I've googled it up and it seemed like it's happened to a few other people. And they said to do a master reset or something like that.","positive":1},{"review":"  I picked this up to take with me on my travels as my Dell died on me recently and I don't like using my work laptop in the hotel and I am not taking my gaming computer on the road (cost for baggage would be astronomical). What I like about this is I can watch movies on the flight in tablet mode.  It is the perfect combination of sleek and power. And people just think it looks cool.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am upgrading my review of my Asus ChromebookC434 M3  8GB after traveling with it for a month.  Initially the touch  screen would often freeze, now it rarely happens and a quick fix is to close the cover and reopen it..and the key board illumination really is not an issue, in fact it is superb, as one merely has to modulate the back light per ambient light.","positive":1},{"review":"  When my daughter needed a computer for middle school, I found the computer she always wanted. When we first got it, it was perfect. My daughter loves, and takes care of her computer. I suggest that anyone should buy any computer on Amazon, and the quality and packaging deserves a 5 out of 5.","positive":1},{"review":"  I liked this computer just fine until the battery stopped working at month 13. It won`t even register as present in the computer. I`ve decided to simply shop for a new computer. Up to this point, it seemed to be a great product.","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing is junk, build quality is poor at best.  Keyboard went to all hot keys, then did not work at all.  I used the touch screen for a few days, then it failed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Amazon poorly packaged this item.  It arrived in an outer box that was 3 times the size needed.  Upon testing, the unit looked ok but one of the speakers was fuzzy and not working well.  I have returned the item for a replacement and submitted a compliant on the poor packaging by Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was excited about this laptop but was instantly disappointed by the speed overall and the trackpad is super loud and feels cheap. The screen itself is pretty nice looking and the keyboard was decent. I gave in an bought a pixelbook go for a few hundred more.

Needs urgent remedy.","positive":0},{"review":"  it is very difficult to use adobe connect on here and you can barely see the key board letters.","positive":0},{"review":"  Half the keys on the keyboard stopped working after 4 days. I called Amazon tech support. I arranged an exchange with Amazon. Fingers crossed that the replacement will be fully functional.","positive":0},{"review":"  Switching from Laptop mode to Tablet mode works as expected, with the keyboard deactivating when folded back.  Unfortunately, when switching back to laptop mode, the keyboard does not reactivate and requires a full reboot to get it to work again.  I am not sure if this is a defect or a known issue, but if it is intentional, it is a terrible design choice.","positive":0},{"review":"  We bought this in July for my son to use. After 2 months of use, he opened it today, one of the rotation support that connects the screen and the keyboard just snapped...","positive":0},{"review":"  Screen went black, but power light was on. Could not force a restart. Then he asked me if I wanted to pay $50 to have the shipping expedited. Nonsense, and I will never purchase an Asus again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Let me start with this. This is a good Chromebook. All in all this is probably the best convertible out there in Chromebook land, with the winner of the clamshell still being the Pixelbook. I wish it was priced a little lower, but not a bad buy for what you get.","positive":1},{"review":"  Honestly, I miss my 11 inch Asus C100. The 14 inch is of course bigger and heavier. I wish the keyboard letters were darker because when backlit, they are hard to see. Still, I do love my Chromebook, and this one is beautiful and solidly built.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a much less expensive version of surface pro and much better touch screen and 14 screen for my son`s school than the 10 beaten up one we got from school.  It`s perfect for him for a better Chromebook without breaking the bank on getting him another MacBookPro that he will destroy within a year.","positive":1},{"review":"  Once you get used to new keystrokes, Chromebooks are fast and handy. What I like about this Asus model is the battery life is looong. Reclining with the Chromebook on my chest, they don't show up at all. If I had it to do over, I'd get black.","positive":1},{"review":"  With Chromebooks (I've had a couple), I find it sooo nice to be rid of Windows.

I don't know what more to say than it is simply the best.","positive":1},{"review":"  ASUS makes a fantastic Chromebook with this model C434. The touch screen is fantastic, along with the screen quality. Android software works great, as well as ASUS firmware options. Definitely recommended for your first-year college students and beyond.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've waited several months to write this review since it takes that long to fully appreciate the good and bad of any device (in my opinion).

Highly recommend as an alternative to anything out there at a fraction of the cost.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am only used to computers with Microsoft operating system and software. Chromebook is not the same. Almost everything is done on the cloud.

Highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a high quality laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice little PC.  Overall, I like it.  It is hard to see the letters on the keys in daylight, they light up at night but you have to look from directly above to see the keys when the room light is on.

Other than that, Bluetooth, WiFi, USB, and screen are awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  First, the one bad thing. You cannot see the keyboard. I wanted sometime to view photos off an SD card. Works great and fast.","positive":1},{"review":"  Amazing battery life and a decently powered processor.

It took a little while to get used to all things Google - and I still try to work out of Microsoft Office on-line (Windows-centric), which can create issues when I click on email links within Outlook emails because the Flipbook wants to convert to Gmail.  I have had to be creative when finding and attaching documents because they are not all Google Docs - I have several clouds that keep me confused, but in general, the learning curve hasn't been bad and the speeds are great.  I like the look, the handleability, and the flexibility with the 360-degree hinges, touch screen, and key pad.","positive":1},{"review":"  Almost perfect.

More laptops with the Ryzen 5 4500u is going to be coming out over the summer with 20% more power and it's suppose to come in at a similar price point.

A few weeks later, it began to put itself to sleep and refuse to awaken. I have used Lenova computers before and found them to be a good problem but this situation has made it so that I likely will not purchase a Lenova in the future.To be fair, Lenova did offer to repair it, but I instead chose to accept a full refund from Amazon because of my need to have a reliable machine for my work and my extreme dissatisfaction with this model of the Lenova Ideapad3.","positive":0},{"review":"  Even tho I get to install the OS I wanted, it gave me some problems getting to the BIOS.

The problem solved when the troubleshooting reseted the Wireless Network Adapter, but it would only worked for a while.e. good screen, good webcam, fingerprint reader, nice built quality, nice port selection, USB C, touchscreen, good battery life, backlit keyboard-this laptop doesn't have any of these) The built is kinda cheap, the screen is not as terrible as the other reviews state (but don't get me wrong it's not good, I'll say it's acceptable at most), the webcam is terrible and it doest have slot of ports (doesn't have an USB C)My conclusion: if what you want is a powerful laptop for the cheapest posible, but you are okay with compromises in other aspects, this is the one for you.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop is overall very good.

The joints are a lil stiff so you do have to push a little hard to adjust it at first, but it loosens up with time.

Not more and not less.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to replace a 6-year old Asus ROG laptop, and at about the same price. Runs well with no problems so far (3rd day of using it).

I have purchased many ASUS items over the years and had great results. ASUS tech support did not offer to help troubleshoot over the phone, they wanted $85 dollars up front for support, so that was the end of my recommendation and support for ASUS.

But what I can`t deal with is that the hard drive is formatted in FAT32, which means you can`t download anything more than 32gb.

I`m a new computer user so I don`t know if I can convert NTFS (games) to FAT32.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this twice, not out of choice but the first vendor send me one with flaws. Second vendor, Holiday Electronics Deal sent me a one in perfect condition. Definitely buy from Holiday Electronics Deal. Also, do your research and check out the specs.","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn't check to see if the computer had a built in webcam and number pad so i had to return it for a computer of similar price that had those features. As for the computer itself, it did everything I wanted. Playing dota on high graphics caused a dip in frames or something but I'd get a huge lag spike that would last awhile. But the computer played anything else with no problem.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this laptop and upon arrival, the secondary 1tb hard drive was not working.

I play guild wars 2 which is a massive open world game with tons of animation.  The speed if the processor is great and the keyboard feels good under my fingers.  The monitor and graphics card are good for what you are paying, but if you have a little extra cash maybe find a laptop with better monitor and graphics card.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love everything about it.

Arrived quickly, and had a good layer of bubble wrap on it. Hopefully the process goes well. I'll update if needed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Defective product.  Integrated camera will not function.  I would not keep this piece of trash if it were free ( I would probably have to pay a disposal fee).

Time to look elsewhere when my money is refunded if ever.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good for running windows and can handle day to day tasks like streaming media and mild gaming well.

Idk what's going on but after everything was paid I spent $500 on a faulty laptop, do not buy unless you know how to fix it, I don't think it's a very complicated problem but definitely a major hassle and people who can't fix it, just throw it in the trash already.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product charger and battery were faulty.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased the Latitude E5470 about 7 months ago as a WFH device.

I ordered the computer on Thursday and it was supposed to be delivered on Monday, But it was delivered the next day. This thing is running like a top now..","positive":1},{"review":"  I received this laptop on time and was pleased with the shipping notifications I received.

I am very pleased with the support service which is key these days.","positive":1},{"review":"  The computer runs great and is in great condition. I did have to get a valid license from the company but they responded right away and took care of the issue quickly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this laptop as a replacement for a Dell I used at another job.

The screen had a tiny scratch but that hasn't affected the display. Overall, they are very happy with it and it arrived clean and ready to go.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am SO Pleased with this purchase. Words can`t describe how refreshing it is for me to find exactly what I was looking for- AND to have it surpass my expectations in speed and command.

Then the battery stopped holding a charge and less than 6 months later completely stopped working because of a faulty motherboard. refurbished or not.  Not impressed and super disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  This refurbished Laptop did not work. It was the worst investment I made. The seller should have been more honest with the quality of product they're selling.","positive":0},{"review":"  The battery only stays charged for 2 hours or less, which doesn`t help if your traveling and working remotely. The screen is dull when upright and more visible when slanted down. It`s sad they couldn`t help especially when I have been a prime member for so long and make 5 or more  purchases every week. I`m considering not to renew my membership.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased 4 of these laptops because I had heard refurbished was a good option for a computer.  Unfortunately I regret it.  When I tried to replace it, noticed someone had replaced it earlier which may indicate that there were changes done to the laptop that may have affected the quality.

I was a little concerned by the (somewhat comical) negative reviews, but decided to order anyway, and chose the Pwr+ model over the (very similar) options because Pwr+ seem to be very concerned with satisfied customers.

I wanted to get a laptop stand that`s easy to use and can be easily moved from home to the library. If you`re someone who would keep their laptop stand stationary and wouldn`t have to adjust the legs often, maybe this product would work out for you better than it did for me.Disappointed with this product, especially having spent $30+ on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  My husband purchased this for me recently and after giving it a few weeks.. Finally, it simply sucks. There are other products available that are more expensive but quite frankly, I would rahter spend more money abd not have to waste 30 mins just attempting to figure out how to use it.","positive":0},{"review":"It's a little cumbersome.  The only thing thats an issue is the way you have to adjust it, because it's a challenge at times.The only reason I give it 3 stars and no less is because it makes a great vertical stand when watching something on the computer in bed, and the cooling fan works great and it is very convenient. I also use this on my desk and position my laptop  slightly vertical , so it is comfortable to type.","positive":0},{"review":"  The picture represents a sturdy laptop stand\u2014 but it is flimsy plastic. I overcame my first impression and tried setting it up. If you blow on them they turn.

Still, I will not be mopving it around much for use in other areas since it is so hard to adjust. Be sure to put something under it like a tablecloth as it will scratch surfaces.  Never did figure out how to put on the side piece or start the cooling motor but it did just arrive so I am still trying.","positive":0},{"review":"  How well this works depends on what you want to do with it.

It's shape curved too soon and my laptop would fall backwards if I didn't put a band around it to literally strap it down onto the stand.

The multiple position options fill almost every laptop owner's needs--from sitting straight up in a chair or on a bed's edge to lying in bed flat on one's back or using it on a countertop in the kitchen or on a sturdy TV tray when one wants to prop a laptop or tablet up in front of a living room or den entertainment center.

I work from a lot and sitting at my desk gets tiring so this makes it super easy to lounge on the couch or bed while working and still be in comfortable position. The other reason for 4 stars not 5 is because I wish the mouse-pad (which easily slides in to a slit on either side, or just left off too) had a small lip at the bottom so if the pad is at incline the mouse would not slide off. But these are both minor issues and are just a comfort rather than an issue with the product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this to elevate my laptop so I wasn't always looking down as I graded and wrote on my laptop (graduate student and professor).  It seems shakey, so I wouldn't use it on anything precarious (like as a standing desk if there was a risk it could be bumped).  That is a surface where nothing but the anti-skid pads on my laptop touches.However, for the price, I'm happy with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works as described.Pros - light weight- infinitely adjustable- sturdy enough for lighter weight machines- stable enough for lighter weight machinesCons - light weight (yes it is also a con)- easy to adjust into very unstable positions- adjustment buttons can be moderately difficult to depressSummary  - This stand does what it says it does. Since it is virtually infinitely adjustable, you can come up with all sorts of crazy designs that on the surface look viable but once you put your computer upon them quickly fail the stability test.However with some common sense and a basic appreciation of center of gravity you should be fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop holder back in 2014 when I had a huge and heavy HD Envy 17 inch laptop. It held up then, and 2 laptops later, it's still holding strong now. This has been extremely handy for me, as I used to travel for work and would just pack this in my luggage and have a portable desk to go. I expect to have many more years of service from it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is awesome. Once I figured out I could have the mousepad holder flat while the laptop was slanted, it felt perfect. It's amazingly strong and stable for a stand that looks like that. As long as you don't have any kids running past it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like the flexibility to adjust the stand to a multitude of different heights but it seems cheaply made.  It's a little cumbersome to get the legs to align perfectly so the table is level.  I was hoping I could put a keyboard under the stand when not in use BUT I doubt there is a full size keyboard that will fit.  It's a small annoyance and not enough for me to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The stand was exactly what I was looking for. The cooling fans were needed to keep my laptop cool during work. I guess you get what you pay for, and it's easier to just replace with another, better quality stand than try to replace the fans. Now it's nothing but a pile of e-waste.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm only keeping it because of the USB fans. The angled joints are a total pain to use on the couch which was my primary usage at first.. I wish you could simply lift them up all together and use a locker to make them stay in place instead of adjusting each joint separately.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a great idea, and I liked it because it helped my wonky body be more comfortable.  But yesterday the fan quit.  LOL.  We could replace the fans but it just isn't worth the trouble.","positive":0},{"review":"  It serves its purpose. i can adjust it to become a standing desk which is nice. So perfect for students who can't buy the automated one with a lever and hydraulics. I did find once I had my laptop at eye level though it made it unable to type on the keyboard so then I had to buy a bluetooth keyboard so I wouldn't be in an awkward position and wear out my arms and hands.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am so sorry I wasted money on this. I have spent HOURS trying to just make it level and be at the right height to what I need. Just bought the Roost, which is what I should have done from the get-go. Don't buy this thing (unless you like Rubix cube puzzles.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's been over a month that I purchased it and for the first time, wanted to use the fan to cool off the notebook, only to find out that the fan needs some sort of charger to work. Yes, it needs to be plugged in. In the description it says, \" Connect USB Cord (Included) to Your Computer to Power The Quiet Cooling Fans,\" but there's NO cable or charger sent with the stand so it's pretty useless. Total waste of $40.","positive":0},{"review":"  The tray is sturdy but it's a lot smaller than I expected, working it into the position you want is frustrating trying to follow the diagrams colors because they put no colors on the legs. But my biggest issue is my mouse pad won't fit into the slats. It's too big or the slats too small and since its metal you cant force it. I prefer my bigger plastic one I bought years ago at Bed, Bath and Beyond, I still have it but the fan or the light doesn't work anymore but I still may go back to it.","positive":0},{"review":"  You will not be able to easily or quickly adjust the height and angle in the fly. It's a PAIN to adjust both sides to the same height. Prepare for a trip down memory lane back to geometry class to get symmetrical angles in the multiple joints. It's really challenging to get both sides even so it will stand sturdily.","positive":0},{"review":"  Its a great item to have for using it on your bed, over your lap, or on a table desk. It is not practical to use by its self while sitting in a chair.Recommend if you like working while in bed, need an adjustable stand for your desk or use on a table.NOT Recommended if you have a small space with no table and expect this to work fine by its self.","positive":0},{"review":"  My cat, Charlie, just waits patiently for me to sit down in my chair and hops up in my lap practically before my butt hits the chair. Of course, that makes  it impossible for me to go on my laptop. I recommend this stand for different uses along with your laptop. Mine assembled looks like the product picture.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am extremely satisfied with this laptop stand, that I own since July 2017. I mostly use it on my bed. The built in fan is a basic one (don't get your hopes up) but it's a not bad addition, I personally don't use it every time, but it definitely helps for prolonged gaming for instance where your laptop starts to heat a lot.It's still a 5 out of 5 starts after 3 years of use.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been a lifesaver. I am on accounting major and he majority of my work is done on the computer.Overall, I highly recommend this product. I did not give it a full 5 stars because it is abbot if a hassle to adjust from one setting to the other, however at this price point you are not going to find much better.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm enjoying my laptop stand enormously. I like to sit in my recliner to work, with my legs up on an ottoman. I'll also be able to use the stand on the kitchen counter, so I can use the cookbooks on my computer more easily. \u00dcber handy.","positive":1},{"review":"  So, first I will get the bad out of the way. The first one of these I purchased came with one of the buttons broken, so the leg would not stay in place.Overall, I love this stand and plan to keep it as long as I can. Those willing to live with the few caveats I pointed out should really consider this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am in LOVE with this product. here are my thoughts after using it for a week or so. you are not planning to do an open heart surgery on it.I teach online, so my camera should always be stable, and it is stable enough that nobody notices when I type.","positive":1},{"review":"  It took me a while Playing Around with the buttons to figure out the legs worked separately and you had to push the button all the way IN to move the leg and hold it in to move it where you want and let go and move and hear it click in place. It has nice markings so you can be sure it is the same on both sides. I have to be careful with my old laptop because it is heavier than most people's new ones and it can fall over. However, for most the ways I want to use it, I find it Very Valuable and  it folds flat when not in use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this so that I can work standing at my desk. Sometimes I do my mini-elliptical while watching videos, and this stand puts my laptop at a good height for viewing while standing. It would also fit over my lap if I wanted to use it while sitting on the couch. Overall, I'm pleased with it, as a basic adjustable laptop stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  I regularly use this to turn my desk (or really any table) into a standing desk with my 15\" laptop and bluetooth mouse (I'm 5' 9\"). Sometimes I use it as a lap desk on the couch or in bed which works well too. Also, the mouse ends up being a little too high for me once I get the screen and keyboard where I want them and my wrist is bent at a weird angle. I put little marks on the adjustable joints at settings I like to make adjusting quicker since getting the 2 sides even can take a couple tries if you don't pay close attention to the angles.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great solution for someone looking for a standing desk with their laptop. I use this desk at my office ~2-3 hours a day.I have other people in my office who use the standard standing desk and they've had issues with sturdiness and also very little space to store them within their cubicles. If you use a laptop as your primary work computer and are looking for a standard desk - this is an excellent solution.","positive":1},{"review":"  I used this on my desk to raise up my laptop.

The concept is great, and using this on top of a table has revolutionized how I work. gaming for a few hours.I will keep using this tray for now, but would prefer to work with a standing desk and lap desk combination instead.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my husband who is bedridden and thought it would be great for him to use his laptop.  The one thing it has going for it is the umpteen positions it can be put in.  The design is very poor in this regard. buy only if you have a newer light laptop and or tablet.","positive":0},{"review":"  The push button adjustments are not the greatest if you are one who works in different space where adjusting is required often.When it`s set up the way you like it and leave it like that permanently then it great. I`ve used it from time to time. Good add on.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was excited to get this stand. It's sturdiness was ok, a bit wobbily, and seems to be made ok but I had one big sticking point which is making me return it. I had it set up tilted to watch a movie and thought it was ok. Luckily I saw it slipping and was able to catch it before it fell on the floor.","positive":0},{"review":"  Cheaply made product that arrived broken. It may have been manufactured at a working standard. If you see a similar looking product for a few bucks less, just purchase that. These stands are all the same and there is no need to spend any more on a product that is exactly the same - cheap plastic.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unexpectedly sturdy, it also has fans that I don't need so extra money spent on that....","positive":0},{"review":"  I was highly disappointed in the product.. I had to have surgery on my backside and needed something I could put my laptop on in order to stand for work. It`s difficult to get it set up to where I needed it and if I needed to readjust I had to take my laptop off of it because the stand would get cockeyed since you can really only move one part at a time.","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved this stand, perfect for what I needed, until the button stuck inside when I tried to adjust.  I have tried everything I can think of to pop it out, but I'll have to buy another stand if I can't figure it out...","positive":0},{"review":"  Excellent overall product.  Helped me with using my Chromebook in a more ergonomic way.  Nice desk. Glad I purchased it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The need to stay at home due to a broken leg, and the need to keep it elevated meant that I could no longer make proper use of my office table, which got me searching for those breakfast in bed trays to use for my laptop. Soon enough, I realized that laptop trays were actually a thing: and boy, were they ever, with TONS of listings here on Amazon. Lastly, while the fan cutouts on the top of the tray are nice and smooth, the ones underneath, where, you know, they may be brushing up against your bare legs, are not, and a bit on the sharper and rougher side. I've mitigated this by taping a single ply of cotton wrap under it, but that's admittedly kind of tacky.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this to put on my desk and be able to stand while I work. It works great for that and for sitting on the floor, sofa, wherever. While it's on my desk, I have useful desk space underneath. It's great.","positive":1},{"review":"  this product is a steal for the price. very well built and the look and finish is beautiful. helped a lot with maintaining proper posture combined with a portable wireless keyboard so you can position the keyboard and the screen at comfortable distances angles. great if you work long hours at a computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I rarely review products but decided to write one for this stand. Before buying it , I spent more than 30 min (for me it is a lot..

Now I seldom work on my desk, and almost always work in the bed, falling asleep when I feel the urge to. It ALWAYS needs to be parallel to the floor, else your mouse will quickly slide down and off the surface. Even if the actual table is tilted(if you prefer your keyboard tilted toward you), the mouse surface still needs to be parallel to the floor.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is a million times better and more versatile than I could have ever imagined.  I need my laptop to be a certain height at a certain angle. It is no trouble at all to adjust from one position to another. Can you tell how much I love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I absolutely adore this purchase, never knew how much I needed it until I had it. I have been able to adjust my computer height from desk to standing and even to my bed and couch which has revolutionized the way I study for school and has reduced the amount of times I have thrown my computer off the bed trying to adjust to the right size. I was able to figure it out and in all honesty have not yet read the package insert so maybe they mentioned some info on this. Also the surface is textured but not terribly grippy so I live in constant fear that my computer may slide right off and I am planning to add some rubberized material for added grip.","positive":1},{"review":"  Admittedly, we use ours exclusively as a laptop stand and it works beautifully. It's solid and sturdy.. seems like a big increase in a short amount of time, but for the price, its still worth it, knowing what I'm getting for my investment.","positive":1},{"review":"  i read in another review someone not expecting a lot out of this product for one reason or another. i felt the same way but purchased after further reading it exceeded ALL expectations. it feels like its apart of my laptop (probably b c the P71 is a tank). a must purchase for any laptop user.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good stand, provides stable support for a laptop up to 17 inch screen. Since the stand is so light, I find it easier to just move it aside rather than adjusting the height when I want to use my laptop from a seated position. I have also found that using the mouse at the same level as the laptop is not comfortable when it is elevated. I recommend, instead, one of the styles with provision for mounting the mousepad on one of the legs.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like this stand. However, ten months in, the fans are grinding. Nope. I must now decide whether to buy a new stand or deal with the RMA shipping process.","positive":0},{"review":"  I couldn`t easily utilize this stand anywhere.. Could not use the mouse attachment because I`m left handed and it was tricky. Wish I would have saved the money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Received my stand this morning.  Upon opening I discovered that part of the lip that holds the laptop in place was broken. I didn't have the stand long enough to really say what kind of quality the stand would have been given that I returned it once I found the broken piece.  There wasn't any damage to the shipping box or the packing box, so it must have been broken before or during the packing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted something that i could carry with me to the airport and on the plane....","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this two months ago to help my neck strain from having to look down at my laptop all the time for work . It works pretty well for my purposes, as a stand to raise my laptop with a bluetooth keyboard underneath. It would be nice if there was some kind of a snap-in bottom or something solid that would sit better on a soft surface if required.- Difficult to adjust once your laptop is already on the stand, as the weight of the laptop makes the buttons hard to push.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is really quite nice and fits perfectly while sitting in a recliner. Only problem is the adjustable leg socket,,it pops out after about using it 5 or so times. We really liked the looks, and portability of it. I would try it again if the issue was resolved.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a very handy little thing. If you want (or have) to work with your computer away from the comfort of your desk.It is easier than setting your laptop on a breakfast tray, and I really did need something after my knee surgery. I just had higher hopes for this.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was not what I was expecting.  This is just lightweight slippy plastic with twisty legs. I was searching for a real product to help me with my issues.  This was not it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Honestly this thing is a nightmare to mess with. I got it for use in bed and it is not very stable there. Returned as I didn`t have use for it. Return was quick and painless, though I imagine that`s just amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  Really enjoy using this stand. The mousepad is not that good (it isn't super sturdy and it is hard to get it to be level when accounting for the weight of your hand on the pad) but otherwise it is very easy to set up and adjust to your liking.If you're lying on your bed, or generally the stand is on unstable ground, it of course isn't as sturdy, but it's also not worse than having your laptop on your lap and indeed much better because you can raise it to your eye level. Regarding the bar which prevents your laptop from sliding, it doesn't dig into your hand and is sort of a good reminder to have your hands a little bit raised when typing (it bullies you into proper form, I suppose).","positive":1},{"review":"  I spend many hours with my laptop.. This was such a perfect solution, everything stays in one piece and not only can I select the perfect height, I can also select the perfect angle for typing. Well worth the money, just wish I had made this purchase sooner.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just got this yesterday.  Since I am now sitting too much I decided I needed a way to stand at home while I work.)  If you are looking for a small, adjustable, inexpensive stand-up desk option this might work for you.  I'm glad I bought this thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is something I've wanted for a while to use while using my laptop or reading my kindle while laying down.  I can position it perfectly over my stomach, though I think were I a larger gentleman it may not be wide enough.  For now I've just done so myself with sugru.Overall, I like this product and use it quite often.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like how adjustable and customisable the stand itself is. I really wish the mouse pad thing was customisable at all. However, with the stand I no longer have to be all hunched over my laptop when I'm working or gaming so it has reduced a lot of neck pain and that was my goal when purchasing it. If the mouse part was adjustable height wise this would be a perfect product and I'd be a customer for life.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this because I was going to be traveling and didn`t know whether I would have a desk where I was going. It worked out perfectly, the legs fold up nice and tight and I could fit it i my carry-on bag on the plane.. sometimes getting the best configuration for how you`re sitting might take a few minutes to figure out, but it`s very versatile, sturdy and I will would recommend it to others who are looking for such an item.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this stand.  I almost didn't get it b c it was a bit expensive for what I thought I needed (just something to raise my laptop up so I could have better posture).  Of course it's not as functional and sturdy as a \"real\" standing desk but as a fraction of the cost, it's well worth it.  It is a bit unsteady wobbly when put up to its extended height, and I'm a bit worried the cats could knock it over, but mostly I'm very pleased and happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had problems figuring out this apparatus because it bends in so many different ways and the turn wheels that adjust it have to be synchronized to get it to the same level. I finally got it to place on my lap with the angle I want it at. Perhaps if you have a wider chair it would probably work. Overall I think it is a good deal for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been an invaluable purchase. I work as a software developer, so I'm on the computer all day. alas, I'd forgotten too much to solve the problem. If the manufacturer provided some more detailed guidelines for use, based on laptop weight and the desired height, I'd certainly award them a well-deserved fifth star.","positive":1},{"review":"  This portable, adjustable laptop stand is everything it is advertised to be. It takes a little bit of practice to get used to adjusting the legs, but having the angles marked on each joint makes it easy to adjust both sides equally. I give it 4 1 2 stars for the minor drawbacks I listed. I am glad I bought it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Silly me, I should have measured, I guess. I thought I would be able to sit on the easy chair and work on my laptop on this stand, but no.  It's well enough made, I guess, and nicely lightweight, just useless for what I wanted.  I'm returning it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't know what other buyers of this product are talking about the sturdiness of this product. But mine is so wibbly wobbly. It sort of worked. I was definitely expecting it to be a lot more sturdy according to the reviews.","positive":0},{"review":"  Returned it for a few reasons.1) Its kind of annoying adjusting it2) Feels way too flimsy, didn't really trust it holding my laptop, but I guess this kind of ties into my next point. Maybe add some rubber pads on the bottom to stop it from sliding. If they had that I would have probably ended up keeping it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not very wide so if you are on the bigger side don`t purchase. Hard to set right so it doesn`t tumble. Was going to send back but it would have been an hour out of my day with Amazons new return policy. You would think as much as Bezos makes he would let us drop off the package at an ups drop off for free, but for it to be free you have to drop it off at an Ups store.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great idea, horrible design. It took my husband and I to get this into position. I purchased this on my own and no one paid me to review this crappy item. Buyer beware and choose another vendor for this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  It looked fine the first day I got this, after a few changes in the position one of the adjustment push buttons broke and got stuck in leaving the stand useless as it will not hold the position.Too bad for the price I paid. I really expected much better quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is super overpriced for the quality and standard. Even with the angles that came with the documentation, the stand is not stable enough. My son tried using it for his school work and cannot do it because it is wobbly and unstable. Can I return it for a refund.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's ok for when im lying in bed or on the couch, but i'll tell you - it is quite a hassle to get it to work and to put it in the position i need it. I just set it on one position and leave it, it is not at alllllll easy to change positions as it shows in the video.","positive":0},{"review":"  This wasn't large enough  for me, and I'm a woman who is of average build.I don't care to be wedged in between the two \"legs.\"  Overall,I'm not thrilled with the product,and am returning it.I suggest buying the widest one possible.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product worked as expected when I first took it out of the box, but broke after using it for the first time.  The platform is sturdy as it is a solid metal platform but the adjustable legs are absolute garbage.  Concept is really nice but definitely not worth my money.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was written after 2 months of use, in a home office.This portable desk is a very flexible and sturdy solution for using a laptop with a secondary monitor, or as your primary screen. I've contemplated purchasing a 3rd party usb docking station and velcro-ing it to the bottom side of the desk.Would definitely recommend this to people who want more than a simple fixed height riser for their monitor or laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a neat stand. The fan is handy if you have a PC that requires it or push your laptop really hard.- the side attachment piece feels a little flimsy. I'm not sure what you'd really use it for- it's small for a mouse, and too unstable to set a beverage on,- the cord for the fan doesn't have a holder or anywhere to keep it while not connected.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love that the height is adjustable. I can use it on the couch as a lap desk or a standing desk extension on my dining table. For those of you who also need hints: no need to unscrew the black thing (that's just for adjusting the tilt on the mouse pad). Have the screw facing you and you literally just insert the short lip into the slot.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this instead of the full desktop options mostly because of the price, but I figured this would be more portable too. I'm happy with it. It takes a minute to adjust each leg to the desired angle, but it's saved my back. If I had the budget for something fancier, I might upgrade, but for now, this works.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my wife and so far so good. It's not super sturdy like a standard monitor base, but it's not meant to. Two issues: The plastic click joints don't make for an ultra sturdy foundation and the bottom legs don't have enough surface contact to ensure traction on smooth slipper surfaces like a dining room table.Overall if this was in the $30-35 range it would be a huge 5 stars, for the price it is good.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m only giving 4 stars because this not simple to get where you want to be.  I`m a mechanical male and I have trouble every time my wife packs it and wants me to setup for her. My wife loves that she can pack it in a carry on and use in a hotel to stand work on her laptop when on business trips. I mark the desired locations so she can do when on trips.","positive":1},{"review":"  This extremely flexible laptop support is exactly what I was looking for. The ingenious jointed legs can be adjusted in an infinite number of configurations, and the locking cam system is easy  to get the hang of and use. Also, if your laptop is exceptionally slim the lip that holds the laptop in place might be uncomfortable and you would have to add some sort of layer underneath so the laptop lines up with the edge. I don't find either of these things much of a problem, but others might.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is large enough for a 17 inch laptop and is secure. There is a lip that runs the entire length of the edge, which keeps the laptop from falling or sliding. otherwise, it's simple. Also, there are degree markings on the dials, which makes it easy to match up the pairs of legs to get a sturdy table.","positive":1},{"review":"  This guy is amazing. You can use it on your desk to create a standing desk, use it in bed, on the go, or on the floor. The only note I may have on this is that it`s tricky to change positions, it`s not super quick or easy. But that`s just part of not spending $300 on one of these guys so I`m okay with that.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use it on top of a desk so I can sit or stand and it works great for that. The mouse holder is a little small for my ergonomic rollerball mouse but it works.","positive":1},{"review":"  This does not at all work well as a standup desk.  When typing it is *totally* wobbly.  I had gotten this with the intent of being able to work in the living room to be near my dog whose paralyzed as he likes the company.  This might be okay for a laptop riser or for sitting in bed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Originally got for using on a bed (which takes a little figuring to find a setting that doesn't tip over) and it worked well there. It has since moved to my desk and it does its job, but it's a little annoying when I want to adjust it, because then the laptop with all of its attached wires has to be taken off in order to make the adjustments.","positive":0},{"review":"  The design is unnecessary complicated. Also the metal and buttons are flimsy. I am so disappointed, I actually don't want my money back, and am purposefully waiting for the the expiration of returns so I can return it and the manufacturer can use my product and connect it to this review.Don't worry, I understand there was no maliciousness involved, but that 5 star rating is inflated.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product DOES what I NEEDED it for, but as for the features and what it's meant to do it's okay.Though it is made of metal, the joints are pretty flimsy,,, So if you have a heavy laptop such as hardcore gaming laptops, I suggest you to get something else with better support. Only good thing about it is that it's quiet. IMHO just don't plug it in and give yourself an extra couple minutes on your battery life.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is certainly pretty good, however it's made for average to small sized folks only. Thus, if you wear size XL, XXL or XXL this will not fit over you while you are on the couch, in a recliner or in bed with a notebook PC.","positive":0},{"review":"  My fianc\u00e9 ordered this and first one of the legs was broken and the fans didn`t work. After returning it he got another that the legs all worked on but the fan has yet to work. I won`t be returning it, but just because it`s disappointing and annoying to keep returning a product and getting another product that only kind of works.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's very bulky and way too big for my 13\" macbook air.

It's just what I needed.","positive":0},{"review":"  It took me a good 30 minutes to understand how to position it properly. I wish it was more functional when adjusting, because it can take some time to get the hang of it.Still pretty useful, and I stand it on my counter top when I want to work standing up to help alleviate tension on my neck, so there's that.Overall 6 10.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s okay. It`ll lift up your laptop but the instructions are kind of screwy on getting the right angle and I thought it`d be something that you could quickly adjust, but it isn`t...","positive":0},{"review":"  Took forever to figure out different ways to configure it. The one way to use it while laying on your bed does not match instructions diagram. It keeps falling  over.  Have to have one leg go back and the other one forward just to remotely keep it in place while using it on your bed.","positive":0},{"review":"  The stand will hold the computer in a wide variety of positions, and works well as a way to convert a standard (seated) desk into a standing desk.  However, if you want to use it as a resting lapdesk you need to understand 2 things:  1)  The legs of the tray are only between 15\" wide between the inner top bars & 17..  Nonetheless, a pair of clamps can hold it securely to the tray table.","positive":1},{"review":"  Buy it. Play around with the settings. You can move it however you want and it can get a bit crazy but honestly you are buying it for the flexiblity so allow it to be that.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this product. And I would've given this a 5-star rating but one thing really annoyed me..they're going to be missing one.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like that my husband does not have to bend down to look at his computer as he is on the taller side 6'4 and he needed it up closer to him.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed a cheap way to make my desk at work a standing desk. This worked well. It isn't the sturdiest thing in the world and it was just barely tall enough for me (I am 5'7\"). The physical therapist in my office wanted to see it be a little taller for my height but I did not feel like I had to slouch or look down too much (I worked 10 hour days with frequent time away from the desk).","positive":1},{"review":"  This is really good. Have not tried standing it all way up but works really well on kitchen bar if u want to stand. Use it every day.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to use instead of an expensive standing desk. It was easy to assemble and adjust to the height and angle I needed. I've been using it for a couple months now, and it is working out very well. I like it and would recommend it to anyone who wants an inexpensive alternative to a standing desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  This portable laptop-Table stand is perfect for holding my Cintiq tablet for digitizing. It has so many adjustments I expect to use it in many ways such as in bed, in my easy chair, standing at a table or to raise my laptop higher. This table has helped me solved a back and neck issue when using my laptop. I really love this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  We purchased a four of these for office use as several of our employees have had back problems including myself. The adjustable legs allow you to alternate sitting and standing easily versus being stuck in one position all day. I reviewed many other similar prodicts and would note that other more expensive units do not include the fan or the mouse attachment. A good investment for those who spend a lot of time on a computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this a couple of days and I'm still experimenting with configurations but it gets my laptop up to just below eye level and places the keyboard at a comfortable typing angle. I haven't bothered with the detachable mouse pad.  The only thing I would have liked to see in the package is stick-on non-skid feet.  I picked up something at the local hardware store that works reasonably well but I think it should have been included.","positive":1},{"review":"  ok so this this item is great of you want to just display your laptop but that's it. As a keyboard riser - standard keyboard will not fit and as it juts out over the edges it begins to fall off the stand. It is impossible to get this flimsy piece of metal to hold true and keep your mouse in place. The items does look sturdy and even looks good but when it comes to function it falls down.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good concept and really wanted to like and use. Unfortunately, the legs are too wobbly and dosen't support a lightweight laptop. Without fabric or padding on mouse tray or under actual mouse, it will slide off. Virtually useless.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like this product.  The flexibility and lightweight design allows me to fold it up and carry it to work and then back home.  I did email the manufacturer and ask what to do, but haven't heard back yet.  Hopefully I will.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am giving 2 star only. Pressing both bottom in the same time to fix the high is not easy.

Sad.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered it, I received it, I opened the package, ....","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought for the price of this the material was just way too cheap.

Not worth it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is as advertised, and for what it is - is fine.  The main issue is that it's hard to adjusts the height and angle.  So if you're wanting to stand and sit several times throughout the day - this ain't the one.  But if you just wanna have something to stand behind ocassionally - it's good.","positive":0},{"review":"  The design hurts the wrists if we use for a little reasonable time.Quality was good but had to return it due to the wrist pain it was causing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this so I can stand at my desk periodically during the day.  It's pretty portable, fits nicely under my desk and is flexible enough to adjust to different heights depending on what I need.  I think under $30 would be a better price point.  That being said, it does what it says it does and I do use it regularly.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop stand is lightweight and versatile.  I use it most often while working in bed.  My ears are still hurting a week later, and I'm dealing with tinnitus.  In short, wear ear plugs.","positive":1},{"review":"  02 27 2016 UPDATEI change my rating to 4 stars because now I like this product, not to use it while working on my laptop from bed but as a Monitor riser for my desktop. As a monitor riser works perfectly, you can adjust it at basically ANY height, so if more than one person is using that computer each one can adjust it as their preferences...","positive":1},{"review":"  I absolutely LOVE this stand. I use this for my MacBook at work to raise the screen up to eye level on my desk. Importantly, it is extremely sturdy. I never worry about it tipping over or my MacBook sliding off, even when I used it on carpeting.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this almost a year ago and it's still going strong. I haven't had any problems with using this table-stand, but the only thing I don't like is how the mouse pad is designed. I would say that's pretty durable and won't wobble much on a level surface. I would recommend this to anyone needing something to set their laptop on for height on desk or table, use for working standing up or just for lounging in bed.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the second laptop stand of this type I have purchased.  I love it.  I wore my first one out until it broke, I will be doing the same with this one, and will replace it immediately with another.  The stand works really well with my small lightweight laptop, I don't know if it would work as well with a larger laptop, but I love it for my purposes.","positive":1},{"review":"  With all the recent hype about the benefits of standing desks, I wanted to try out the concept without spending megabucks. This desktop stand was a good test.  All in all, it served the purpose for which I bought it, and I'm still using it in other ways. Not perfect, but good enough.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a very nice folding laptop table, and I am using it to write this review.  It was just what I was looking for to get a hot laptop off my lap while lying in bed.  One word of caution, the fans run even if the laptop is turned off, so it's important to either switch them off or unplug them from the laptop so as not to drain the battery when not in use. The removable mouse platform is a nice feature, but I don't think I'll be using it much as I use the mouse pad on my laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have one and cant stop myself from ordering one more for my friend as a birthday gift since she likes to study and watch movies on her bed. It is perfect and so convenient.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ergonomic- I have arthritis throughout my hands and I am having difficulties pushing the adjust buttons.

I have it set up as pictured, and with the laptop screen fully extended, I can get it about 27\" off the table, which is higher than I need. It's far too cumbersome to try to do it with both sides at the same time.Good product for the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my office.  Not easy to get set up and one of the adjustment \"joints\" was broken when it arrived.  Can't use the attachment for the mouse, it slides off.  I will have to rig up something to make it work.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not very stable.  And since the surface where you place the laptop is metal. Cost $700 to replace.  Not worth the expense.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love the product except now it's appearance is quite shoddy. The paint began chipping within 2 weeks with not that much use...","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to start standing at my desk so I thought this would be the perfect product to hold my keyboard and mouse. After receiving it I had everything set up to the right height and the way I thought I would be using it..I returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use a 17\" laptop and when I use the stand on my bed or sofa it isn't very steady.  For a lighter laptop it is probably much better.  I think the bottom feet should be wider so it's more steady.","positive":0},{"review":"  i was very excited to get this and use all around the house, but it's really a little cumbersome to move around and adjust.  I just have it adjusted to use when I'm sitting in bed and that's the only place I use it.  There is also a screw head on the bottom of the one the \"legs\" that I discovered when using on my table (oops).  works well for moving my laptop to eye level which is what i needed due to neck pain.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received my Adjustable Laptop Table. I chose this one because of the great reviews. If I cannot find a YouTube video to explain how to attach (which I shouldn`t have to resort to) I will return this and purchase another. It should not be this complicated.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is nice but is not quite as sturdy as I thought. The metal is on the top and on the mouse pad but the legs are still hard plastic or whatever it's called and I'm afraid it will break easily.5 rating not 3 but it will only show 3..","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted a stand I could use for my laptop that required me to stand up, without spending a ton of money on those standi sit desks.  So this is an economic solution to that.  The mouse attachment thing is good, but not generally big enough to move it very far. Overall, it's a low cost way to stand for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm sure this laptop stand is as good as any others out there in the same price range, but I was disappointed with how the plastic legs have very little friction with the table. It slides around too easily, and when tall, I'm afraid the stand will fall over. It needs something sticky on the bottom to keep it from sliding, as well as something heavy on the legs to keep it from falling over. Now, it can definitely stand on its own and not fall over if you don't bump it, but there's too high a risk of my laptop tumbling to the floor.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an awesome laptop stand. My neck was hurting from looking down at my laptop while at my desk and this has really made a difference. It's also got a fan built in which will probably be convenient in the hot climates of Pakistan and Egypt, but I have yet to test out the fan. It also doubles as a convenient book stand when needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  Once you get it adjusted right (which takes some fiddling), this is a great lap desk. Makes it easier and more comfortable to work from a bed or couch, no more pillows that impede air flow. It sits at an outward slant so my mouse often slides off. I added an actual mouse pad to the holder, which helps, but there's no edge to keep the mouse from sliding.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like the tray and actually use it for my keyboard at work, not my laptop so I can have a comfortable standing desk.  It has allowed me to get my keyboard to the perfect height.  I'm pretty confident the mouse paid piece will end up breaking or becoming useless.  It comes off as something the manufacturer created as an afterthought.","positive":1},{"review":"  great stand with more configurations than you will ever need- some of them are jokes.. I've found that it needs a normal desktop mousepad put over it in order for your mouse to work properly. The pad is uneven and bumpy, you'll end up destroying your laser mouse with scratches or being really inaccurate with your ball mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  Outstanding product - For the price and quality I was very well pleased. Began research on a standing desk and came across this option. I don't use a mouse but the mousepad seemed to function well enough for those who want that option. Highly recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand works pretty well for my needs: a flexible platform for a small notebook (Asus Transformer T100). It easily conforms to fit several use positions from sitting on a couch, lying in bed, and even as a keyboard platform for my crude standing desk setup. I might use it if I had a standard spinning (read: hotter) hard drive, though.Overall, I was pleased enough with the stand and its price to buy a second one for my standing desk setup at work.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a great present for my writer-daughter, who is writing from home now, during the pandemic. It can be moved into many different positions and makes her work more comfortable when working on any surface in her home.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does what I needed it to. I can stand and do my homework, it helped with the tension in my shoulders because I could sit more ergonomically correct. All in all it was worth buying. It is true that it seems a little flimsy feeling but one just has to realize it is made out of plastic and it still works great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use my laptop a lot and was looking for something to serve as a decent work station. This table is well built and solid.  Other then that, I don't feel there are any cons with this product.Bottom line:If your needing something that`s not too difficult to lug with you that can serve as a mobile work desk at an affordable price, this table will get the job done.","positive":1},{"review":"  The mouse pad attachment thing falls off easy, but the 11 year old is not gentle with it, and it still works fine and looks brand new.","positive":1},{"review":"  unstable product, you cannot lean on it, it takes a while to put together until you get the hang of it. Otherwise on the positive side, it serves the purpose if you want to stand and not sit all day, just can't lean on it, or put your hand on the mouse piece. I still think the price should be no more than $30. I honestly have used it a few times only and I have had it for about 2 months.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s very sturdy and easy to manipulate, however it absolutely is not tall enough to stand up and use as a sort of tray table while sitting in chair or on a couch. I`m 4`11 and have a very short legged couch so that feet may be able to reach the floor when sitting (#shortpeopleproblems). This item isn`t even tall enough to reach the bottom cushions of couch.","positive":0},{"review":"  Poor quality, doesn`t work as advertised, legs don`t work well.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love the idea and loved using the stand a couple of times before it broke. So I bought another one. This renders the whole thing useless. Wish the quality was better as I liked the 3 times I was able to use the two I bought before the both malfunctioned.","positive":0},{"review":"  Okay the stand works ..  just died.  there are 2 fans but one of them is dead and smells of burning wires so i had to unplug the unit.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was so excited for this and wanted to like it,  but unfortunately on two of the notches  the degrees don`t line up so it makes it very difficult to adjust it to match up with the other side. It`s ok if I don`t try to adjust it which was the whole point of it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't like how you have to adjust it. The buttons sometimes don't push in and hurt my finger. It is not easily adjusted and somewhat complicated but not worth sending back because it charges almost $9 shipping and I don't live near a UPS store.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is made of cheap plastic.  I purchased it to sit over my lap on the bed or recliner.  Definitely not something that works sitting in bed, sofa or recliner.  I sent it back immediately.","positive":0},{"review":"  Once you have it in a position, you are best leaving it there, it is not like you can easily adjust, while keeping it level, with your components on top of it..  So your lap top has to come off, and that mouse pad attachment also needs to be removed or you risk dropping it also.  Clever idea, but needs some work on the execution to be worthwhile.","positive":0},{"review":"  both sides need to be adjusted simultaneouslyand it's crazy uncomfortable.does not work great with surface pro,as the wight is mostly on the screen.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had a different use. I hate the screen wobble on most sit-to-stand desk systems so I bought the monitor mount and needed something for the keyboard. Current configuration works just fine as you'll see in the photos. Be sure to get rubber pads as it will not stay put without them.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased one for my son who is in college, then I purchased another for a teenager who works a lot on the iPad and computer, then I purchased one for my sister.  They all love them.  I have not used the fan or mouse stand yet.  I work on a small Mac so it is big enough for me to work on without the mouse table.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am so happy with this stand..Overall though I give it 5 stars. I would definitely buy this again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like using my Wacom Cintiq Pro 16 in my lap on the couch to work on art when I'm lounging at home and wanted to get something that made doing that more ergonomic. This thing is the perfect size and has the perfect angle for doing just that. I'm only docking this thing a star because it doesn't feel super sturdy, but I think it's good enough for the price. I may eventually get the more expensive version of this sort of device if it gets too rickety, but it's fine for now.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this because sitting for prolonged periods is not conducive to good health and can lead to back problems.  If you have a job in which you sit in front of a laptop for most of the day, I recommend this product because the price is reasonable and the height is adjustable.Shipping for this product was very fast.  I received it within two days with normal shipping arrangements.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a Pwr+ Laptop-Table Stand with Mouse Stand.  My posture isn't always the best and at times i can feel my back and shoulders starting to ache from the extended hours behind my computer screens.There are many products on the market that could meet your needs.  But, for the price and versatility, I highly recommend the Pwr+ Portable Laptop-Table-Stand with Mouse Stand to anyone who wants to try standing while you work.","positive":1},{"review":"  The stand works very well for me: it allowed me to test whether I would use a standing desk for a very reasonable investment.  I don't use the stand to hold the laptop.  However, I gave the stand 5 stars because it has been very useful for my purposes at a very good price.  I will probably be looking for a more permanent standing desk in the future.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall the Pwr+\u00ae Portable Folding Laptop Notebook Book Table Desk Tray Stand with Cooling Pad and Mouse Mice Pad   Cup Stand Fully Adjustable Angle Legs - Black, seems to be decent purchase.  It comes nicely boxed with a paper showing you the positioning available for your tray, but no further instructions.  I will more than likely try to find a better alternative for my mouse to rest on, especially since I am a gamer.  But it should be more than fine for a standard web user or for those who use a smaller mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this stand because I was going to be bedridden for several weeks and needed to be able to work on my laptop from basically flat on my back. Although the width of the stand isn't quite wide enough to straddle my hips which include a brace, it can straddle me at the waist. Overall very sturdy and yet lightweight. Definitely fit my needs and budget.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this device, it gets my laptop off my legs and the angle adjustment is perfect for putting the keyboard just where I want it.  Have no complaints.  I am a larger person and it could be slightly wider, but it is not uncomfortable in the least and I use it daily for extended times.","positive":1},{"review":"  Hard to adjust and get even.  You have to push in those knobs on either side and it clicks and then you adjust the other one and it clicks and the stand is not right and then you keep clicking and it`s just so annoying.","positive":0},{"review":"  I would not recommend, I ended up throwing this away.  It was not easy to move and very cumbersome to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  It seems to take a bit of work to get it where you want it. And if I lose the direction sheet showing all the positions, I`ll be screwed. So it`s ok. Not what I had hoped exactly.","positive":0},{"review":"  They are receiving a three star, right now, because the USB connection to the fan does not fit.  The white piece Inside the male side of USB side is too wide to fit into the female side of a USB.","positive":0},{"review":"  While I like the concept of a laptop stand like this, the workmanship appears to be shoddy. The stand provides three separate buttons to press to allow you to change it's positioning. Unfortunately, one of those buttons, when depressed, will not lock in again. This has left the stand simply swaying freely and not stable enough to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  it's good for what I need, but the feet can be a little tricky the first time, I keep getting them crooked because I couldn't read the numbers.  They also did not send instructions for the mouse pad, I had to contact them and they sent a photo of how it was attached, there are still two little pieces of rubber which I have no idea what to do with.  i assume they are to hold the mouse pad in place, but again, no instructions.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product was defective out of the box. One of the buttons to adjust the angle got stuck literally the first time I pushed it rendering the product completely useless. I was really excited because on paper this product is excellent. Sad to see such a great idea go to waste due to poor matterial and quality control.","positive":0},{"review":"  It works ok. Kind of tippy and you will decapitate a finger very easily if you aren't paying attention. Putting my $1000 laptop on this makes me nervous so I lay a piece of wood across the bottom legs and vise grip it to the table so the thing won't tip over. Very cheesy and my wife hates it but I hate her so we're even.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like almost everything about this stand -- the versatility is amazing -- except the height when I have it set up to use while I sit on my sofa is totally unsatisfactory.  I needed a TV-tray height.  Sure, I can fold the legs and make it like a lap desk to set it ON the sofa with me, but then it becomes unstable due to my body weight and constant fidgeting.  I should have read the specifications better before ordering.","positive":0},{"review":"  The stand DOES adjusts, but it is maddeningly difficult to get it adjusted evenly on each side.  The stand was supposed to come with an integral fan, but NO CORD WAS INCLUDED.. Grrrr.","positive":0},{"review":"  It does the job, but it can wobble if you`re not precise setting up each leg. It`s sturdy enough even when my cat decides its time to pay him attention and comes up from underneath. I use it every other day. Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The stand seems to be fine, holding my 9lb gaming laptop without any issue, we will see as time goes on though. My only gripe is this mouse platform that is included, it is laughably small, like barely larger than my mouse small. Clipboard is sturdy enough not to bend with use, and light enough not to over stress the small bracket included with the mouse platform. Hope this helped.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love that is has the cooling fans and the attachment for a mouse.  This width is a little narrower than another one I also purchased so it fits better over you lap but may be a little too narrow for larger people.  The other one I purchased has a nice rounded over cushioned write guard on the raised bottom edge of the laptop tray.  If this stand had this feature I would have given it a 5-star.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is great.  It meets my need for laptop elevation just fine.  My 4-star rating is because the mouse platform is not quite big enough and I would like it to be a little sturdier.  Other than that, I am very pleased with the product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my home office, it alleviated my neck pain.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'd been looking for something I could put my computer or artwork in progress on while sitting on the couch or floor without killing my neck and back and this does the trick. I can put it to basically whatever sitting height or angle I want and it stands pretty sturdy. It's wide enough I can rest it over my lap if I want and I like that it comes with a paper guide to all the different positions in which it can stand well. The fan works great though I haven't had to use it much.","positive":1},{"review":"  The PWR+ adjustable table is one clever invention.  It's like having a robot to hold your computer for you.  I may have misplaced the cord for the fan (USB directly to laptop), and I still haven't worked out what the little black plastic clip is for..","positive":1},{"review":"  This portable laptop table is perfect for people who like to use their laptop on their bed or sofa. It does take a bit of getting used to adjusting the angles (of all three settings) but it comes with a picture which tells you exactly which angles you need to set each button to in order to achieve the height that you want. Also, I do like the fact that it comes with a detachable drink holder but I don't use it much because my drink tends to slide off of it, so it would be better if it had a sturdier grip. All in all, it is a great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Pwr Laptop stand has met my need for a desktop stand that puts my computer screen at eye level, which is critical because I wear glasses. No more craning my head up or down to see through my bifocals - no more stiff neck. I purchased anti-skid material and this has solved that problem. Over all, however, I am extremely satisfied with the stand and strongly recommend it for anyone with needs such as mine.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it.  Wish I'd found this years ago.  You can haul it around easily and it doesn't take up a ton of room on a desk or table.  It feels like plastic, but is indeed aluminum.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does what is says it does and the fan is nice, if a little loud. For the price, however, I was expecting it to be much easier to manipulate the arms.  Also, I wish there was something to keep the mouse from falling off the mousepad arm when the top is tilted.  This product is probably best for someone who is looking for a permanent stand rather than someone who needs to reposition things.","positive":0},{"review":"  Too many joints and poor design. I spend more time trying to get this gadget adjusted so I use It comfortably then I do actually using it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Its very difficult to change from one position to the other.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have received the item on time. Overall, the packaging was  OK. However, after unboxing, I realized the item was damaged or either it was used. Otherwise, it is sturdy and flexible.","positive":0},{"review":"  This seemed like it would fit the bill for someone who uses a laptop on their lap (lol) and it does what it says. My annoyance with it is that I can't leave it set up and adjusting it each time I need it is a bit of a pain.  The two sides have to be adjusted individually and it's not always even.  It's a sturdy product for the price and I hope I get used to it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Laptop stand works well but the mouse part, even with a mouse pad, isnt flat smooth enough of a surface to move the pointer smoothly on the screen . I use this for a standing desk but have to leave the mouse on my desk.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a very sturdy laptop stand and I'm so glad I purchased it. It has completely eliminated my neck strain. I'm a smaller person but curvy (I wear a size 10) and the legs press into my thighs when I sit it across my lap.

I only prefer to buyer that if u have 17 inch notebook as I have, please check it carefully before you buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Its convenient and I love the metal trays with vents.  The legs although well constructed are plastic (loose 2 stars) but the joints are easy to use and the whole thing is portable so if ur in a bind, this is for u.

Had I known that would fix it in one position and would never touch. Still recommend, just be careful.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this laptop table stand adjustable riser on June 7th of 2018. I've given it a thorough rebel blackstone 1 year test and it has come close to a five star product but unfortunately it missed the mark.My recommendation would be for the company to include anchors that can mound to the various surfaces and platforms you use the riser on. Good product, but could definitely use a few tweaks.","positive":1},{"review":"  It fit perfect for what i need, very easy to set up and use as as well, one thing that you guys can improve here is about how to set up the mouse pad, took me a while to figure that  since there is no pictures or any how to step by step the rest of it has description photos to use it in different angle and so on apart from that i recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was just what I`ve been looking for.

I work in bed sometimes, to get snuggled in and always found it difficult to do the necessary editing and design work I needed to do.

It is everything it is described to be, we highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've used this stand with 2 different laptops,including a 17\" Dell, in a variety of recliners and a couple tabletop situations.  It's adapted to them all remarkably well, allowing me to position my work at the optimal height and angle in each case.  My machines never run hot enough to make the cooling fans necessary, but there's no downside to having them.  The only negatives I'd note are the mouse pad, which is too small and flimsy to be very useful, and 3+ lb weight, which makes the stand unwieldy for traveling.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great concept. I used it this morning for my keyboard and mouse (I work off three monitors) at least two hours. Using it for a standing desk, for just the keyboard and mouse puts all of the weight in the top right corner of the stand thus taking the left bottom leg off the table ever so slightly.It's lightweight and sturdy enough that I'm taking it with me to work next week so I can use it there too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like to stand while working just to keep from sitting in my office chair for 9 hours every day and this actually does the job fairly well.  I like that it's adjustable (they even give you a 'legend' to show you different positions you can use), but sometimes it can be a little difficult to adjust.  It's not the most awful thing in the world, but for me it's a little annoying.  All in all, the product certainly does the job and I'm glad to have it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is very versatile. It can be used at different heights and at different angles.Most important factor for me is that I can remove it but keep it on the same desk in 15 seconds, as it does not take much space. Then I can stand when I want and sit down at will.","positive":1},{"review":"  Muy excelente producto da comodidad.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this thing - works great for bed, watching Netflix or playing games.Only issue was that the fans blew but laptop was flat on surface. I had to glue a cork wine too cute in half to the surface so the laptop has some space to vent and for the fans to circulate air. So it wasn't just flush on the top of it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the versatility of this piece. Lite and easy to mover around. The adjustment markers are clear to see for fast easy adjustments.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is great--sturdy, easy to adjust to several different heights and angles--but I'm shaving a star off for packaging and a bit of frustration in setting it up: While the stand included some very basic directions, included in the package was also a mouse tray and four pieces of hardware in a separate little bag, with no directions whatsoever on how to attach the mouse tray or what the pieces were for. I figured out how to attach the mouse tray and the cord for the cooling fan through trial and error (as well as looking closely at the product picture on Amazon), but I still find myself left with two mystery pieces, the purpose of which I couldn't even begin to hazard a guess. I hope they're not important, because at this point I'm just gonna throw them in a junk drawer and hope for the best.","positive":1},{"review":"  Present problems with one of the switches or buttons proximal to place the degrees this is sunk and does not remain fixed which makes it impossible to remain stable on one side.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love the product for the price.

I thought it would be easier to set up but it isn't. You have to follow picture instructions on angles for the table. Sometimes it can be a hassle but at least it's lightweight.","positive":0},{"review":"  Difficult to expand and align both sides. When the computer was on the stand, the stand would shake quite a bit while I was typing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I work on a laptop at work and my neck was starting to hurt.

When plugging the fan into a Mac, it instantly caused a crash - wouldn't recommend using the cooling fans at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just received this product.

It has transformed my productivity as I usually work standing in the mornings and back and forth between standing sitting in the afternoons.","positive":1},{"review":"  ELearning kept me at a desk and I hated it as a teacher. This allows me to stand, to outside,  move to a comfy chair and change up where I can be with my laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recommend this stand.  It works well on a desk if you need to raise your laptop.  They are to raise the \"lip\" of the stand in case you're worried about your laptop sliding off.  The lip should be facing you like the picture indicates.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this thing.. I use a laptop as my computer and was having issues with dry eyes and neck pain from not being at eye level with my laptop screen for hours a day, this completely did the trick. Worth every penny.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great product and the adjustability has allowed me to use it for multiple purposes, not just a laptop tray.  I purchased the Pwr+ Portable Laptop-Table-Stand with Mouse Pad as a tool to assist me in recovering from an upper back injury so that I could read books hands free or use my laptop.  I would to see this be more comfortable, maybe a rounded edge would work.  In any case really like the product and I have multiple uses for this tray.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall I'm impressed with this product. I was looking for something to help turn my desk into a standing level desk and this fit the bill. Likely a trade off for weight.- No lip on mouse tray meaning the mouse try must lay flat.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm very happy with this purchase. I have a 17\" laptop and it fits perfectly on the table even w  the aftermarket laptop battery I have on the laptop (makes it not flush with the battery  in the back by about 1 2 inch), the laptop fits on the table. It`s easy to attach on left or right side of table. I leave it off more often than not, but it`s useful when I need it.","positive":1},{"review":"  These are such a great tool.  My kids do online school and I wanted something that they could use as a standup desk.  They seem to really like them.

If you want to adjust it quickly this is not the product for you.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not particularly easy to adjust to different positions. You must remove any item on it to adjust each of the three hinges on either side - which are independent of each other, so it takes an extra effort to make sure they are even.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the idea of it but it's so difficult to change between different configurations, it makes it unusable. Also, the side mouse tray is difficult to attach and use as the legs get in the way requiring it to be removed and put on constantly.","positive":0},{"review":"  This desk does the job. It takes a while to learn how to maneuver the settings on the desk, but overall it`s a good product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very durable but cumbersome to move the legs around and get them even.","positive":0},{"review":"  It works fine, but doesn't get into as many positions as I really needed.  Sometimes hard to get the joints to move and takes a bit of playing with to get into the right position.","positive":0},{"review":"  First off, I've been using cooling pads for my laptops for close to 15 years. With that said, I've been using this for a few months and this has to be the best cooling pad I've used yet. The only problem I've had with this pad so far is that the rubber feet on the bottom that cover the screws have come off, which I've had that happen to all the cooling pads I've ever owned. So if you're wondering if this is the cooling pad for you, it's worked wonderfully for me and it keeps my laptop cooled down while gaming and I believe it will do the same for you.","positive":1},{"review":"  This arrived yesterday with my new gaming system and it's just what I was looking for.

But my laptop completely covers the lights, so no problem there.The ONLY nit I have to pick is that a couple of the little rubber pads that are stuck on the bottom of the pad have fallen off and I've lost them, But that is minor compared to the fact that this cooling pad actually cools my previously non-coolable laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have my 17 inch gaming laptop on this thing all the time. My laptop is usually on the couch or on the bed so this helps provide air flow on those soft surfaces, even without the fans on this things helps.

I desperately needed the temp to be cooler since it was burning up.  I think a lot of the cooling properties of this item also has to do with the fact there are pegs in the back of the pad that come out and put your laptop at an incline, so it isn't ventilating into a flat surface, but in an open area.  Works very well, I will definitely recommend this product to anyone.","positive":1},{"review":"  Five fans with speed control. WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE.

Taking away a star.Intakes for each fan are on the bottom surface and directly in line with the fans, so they are easily blocked if you try to use this on your lap.Fans on the bottom edge are kind of superfluous as they are not near any intake on most current models of laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have an old ASUS laptop that overheats often, sometimes multiple times a day. In the summer, I have a Vornado aimed at it.Plus: it seems to lower the temperature 1 to 2 degrees Celsius, it isn't noisy, if you position the laptop right it'll blow some air your wayMeh: I used to put the laptop up on wooden blocks, because I use it like a desktop with a monitor, now I put the cooling pad up on wooden blocks to keep air flowing underneath, if I use only the cooling pad it will overheatMinus: the fans aren't that strong, it cools only about 1 to 2 Celsius which may not be enough come summertimeIt is overheating ~80% less since I started with this cooling pad, but my hunch is it won't do much in the summer. Still worth it to squeeze more life out of a laptop well beyond its life expectancy.","positive":0},{"review":"  At first glance, it is very cheap, of course. Very light and thin which is not bad. The cooling pad is not dirty, has never been mishandled, but for some reason it has been declining.

I`m sure there`s better products out there.","positive":0},{"review":"  No change in cpu or gpu temp with any use of the laptop (light  moderate  heavy).  Arguably it will increase the internal temperate of the computer during light uses due to having to draw power from the ps and mb. It is essentially a usb powered fanned platform that your laptop can sit on. I reduced stars because of shotty construction and not performing the task we purchased it for (cooling the computer past what the laptop is capable of).","positive":0},{"review":"  Literally just received from USPS 5 minutes ago. Hooked it up, nothing. Very cheap, skeptical, all these chinese manufacturers make the same things, remove a fan, name it something different and there is absolutely NO quality control.

There are some other cooling pads which have less fans but do its job to the mark.","positive":0},{"review":"  May be better for ultrabooks, but it barely cooled my gaming laptop. Only made a difference of maybe 2c-3c max. It was quiet, but because it put out very little air.

My desktop computers run day and night and the fans don't begin to fail for several years of use. Why do they put these cheap-ass fans into these laptop coolers.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the design of the pad with the two USB ports and the adjustable fan speed. However, they put the two USB on one side and my USB ports on the other side made it inconvenient to connect the pad to my computer. The only time the fans are whisper quiet when I turn them off.I just received my cooling pad yesterday so I will keep updating my review with time.","positive":0},{"review":"  About two years ago I finally got wise about my Macbook Pro warming my lap and purchased my first cooling pad.  I wrote a raving review about the product -- you can read that review by clicking on my name -- however it is no longer available.  I think it will perform admirably for your cooling needs.  It's a well-built, solid cooling pad that I think will last you for many years to come.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this thing just about daily for gaming and I really love it.After some testing, it seemed to drop temps about 3-5c which was about all I was expecting from an external fan solution.If you are looking for quality, features and a great price then I highly recommend this laptop cooler. I have not regretted purchasing it at all.","positive":1},{"review":"  This pad works fairly well.  The fans don't push a lot of air, but does make a difference to just have some circulation.I would love to see a version with a full USB 3.2 hub, with 3 or 4 additional ports to expand it even more.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this in 2018 for my Dell Alienware 15 R3 because if anyone is familiar with those laptops they get extremely hot quickly along with sounding like a Boeing taking off for flight.This cooling pad works very well and what I like in particular about it are two things. This cooling pad is powered by a USB link from the pad into a USB port on your laptop. Where they thought ahead here was rather than have you lose an entire USB port to power the cooling pad they added a second USB port on the cooling pad itself which actually has worked perfectly for me in terms of any device working as it would if it were directly connected to the laptop itself.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this fan. It even has feet at the back to lift it up with your computer on it, which makes it very ergonomic.) I very highly recommend this fan and researched it before buying. It was rated as one of the best in an affordable price range.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the longest time I was worried that there was something seriously wrong with my laptop because the lag I got when playing online games was intense.  I thought that my laptop was defective at first, then I realized that the internal temperature was getting way too high (It sometimes peaked at 60 C 140 F).Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product.  It's perfect for cooling and it fits my 17-inch laptop perfectly.","positive":1},{"review":"  Matches my HP Omen. Looks good as a stationary unit (my laptop is retired to desktop mode only).

I do not expect this thing to have a long life-span with all the moving parts and plastic design.","positive":1},{"review":"  Did drop CPU and GPU temps down about 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit each during max performance. Also provides a buffer between the bottom of laptop from your skin so you're not burning up as much from a hot laptop.

Protect your investment, which this does an adequate job of.","positive":1},{"review":"  Was looking for a fan to cool down an old laptop this does seem to be fairly powerful however it is pretty bulky and takes up a lot of desk space so if you`re in a tight confinement I don`t know if this is the right direction you want to go. it`s fairly silent however as a hobby I do like making videos for YouTube and it`s a bit too noisy as it is picked up in the background of any recordings..that could be Beneficial or a drawback depending on how you look at it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased two of these for laptops in my household.  They work really well to control the computer temperature.  If running gaming applications, the fans can get a little loud, but in this scenario we are wearing headphones and do not notice the sound much.Overall, it I am happy with the purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  It has been stationary for a year so it hasn't been banned around except for extremely slight moving around on desk. The rubber grippy on the bottom fell off so it slides a bit more. About two fans work at at time but most of the time it remains broken. Pretty much garbage and wouldn't buy again.","positive":0},{"review":"  After reading the reviews on this cooling pad I had High Hopes :( The fans do not move a lot of air at all.

I will keep it but had to order another fan to connect to the cooling port on my laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Even with the pad raised to encourage air flow, the fans are not strong enough to aid in cooling a laptop. The video showcasing the weak air flow with a tissue is accurate. When I turned on a temperature display on my other fan I did not notice a temperature drop when using this cooling pad. I returned this for a full refund.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's VERY quiet. Probably because it really doesn't seem to move much air. I mean there IS some air, just not enough IMO to really make a difference to help cool my gaming computer. I guess something is better than nothing, but I'll be looking for another cooling pad to compare.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product is okay. I bought it for my acer predator and I didn't like the air flow. I gave it to my gf and order the cm storm which is way better but cost more. Lights and fans are one so you can't shut off lights without shutting off fans also.","positive":0},{"review":"  My laptop would continually overheat to the point that it would shut it self off during long gaming times.  This guy keeps my laptop at a constant 145-160 degrees during gaming which is fantastic.  It's a cheaply built unit using cheap parts and sold for a cheap price.  Next go round I may opt for a more expensive unit with higher grade fans.","positive":0},{"review":"  the cooling fan worked great but lasted a mere 4 months. at that point, the fan started making a loud and terrible noise and stopped working. they are purposely made to be difficult to actually obtain reimbursement or replacement, thereby wearing down the consumer.lesson learned.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall it's a low-quality product it works well for a month but then the fans eventually stop spinning, the only thing that lasts long is the LED lights inside the product probably because they cant turn on fully off of the USB, speaking of the USB the passthrough port doesn't provide enough power to pass anything through. if you try to plug in a phone it won't charge even with the fans on minimum power. Overall get a different fan that is less extravagant for working features.","positive":0},{"review":"  I give it a 3 star because honestly..1ghz4x8gb 2666mhz corsair ddr42x512gb pcie3x4 m.2 ssd1x1tb evo 860 ssdGtx 1070 full not max qOh well least maybe I can play in bed without my jewels melting.","positive":0},{"review":"  I mostly would say that this is the perfect cooling pad for a gaming laptop.

I've always wanted a legit gaming computer but my parents never splurged, so I settled with integrated graphics my whole life. To keep it short, logically, it makes sense that by placing the laptop onto a LIFTED stand, it allows more airflow under the laptop. The 5 extra fans can pull in air and also blow into the laptop which *should* help cool it, but if it doesn't what's the worst that can happen.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this in March of 2018 and we love it.

Its like how you get use to your cars AC being turned on and you are still able to listen to your car stereo. I hope the red LED would have been bright enough or rather placed somewhere else so it would illuminate the surrounding area, but it doesn't illuminate all that much. So if anything the Red LED isn't too bright that it bothers me but its not bright enough to even help or be noticed so at this point I'd say don't buy it if you wanted some ambient  red light, but its an okay nominal noise laptop pad cooling fan.","positive":1},{"review":"  My Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series laptop was emitting a little too much heat and causing a discoloration to the natural wood dining table where I use the computer most.

What I like about it is that it is very light weight so I can easily lift it with the laptop together when transitioning from one desk to another in my work space.

Will likely have to purchase another one that is a little higher quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  UPDATE: I want to be clear that after contacting Havit, they sent me a new unit with no hassle, however, there is an inherent design flaw in the design of the unit (the replacement has now lasted 2 years but has the same issue with the short in the on off switch) for anyone who uses a laptop IN THEIR LAP, the on off switch will rub against the chair arm and eventually short out.A few months ago my cooler developed a short in the speed control knob. It also makes a horrid loud sound intermittently.If you don't mind replacing your cooler on an almost yearly basis, this unit is for you.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product claims to fit 17 laptops, it doesn`t. The fans don`t help cool at all when under load, partly because the fans barely provide any airflow. You`re better off putting your laptop on a tray or something and saving your money. I will say it looked pretty good and the usb pass through is nice.","positive":0},{"review":"  All 5 fans work like they should, but very underpowered and made very little difference in CPU temp (5\u00b0 Celsius or less), and computer even got hotter than it ever has while gaming, even with it on.Would recommend if you have a cheap laptop with little storage where you can actually store anything that requires extra power that would make your computer work harder where it would need a secondary cooldown source like this. Would not recommend if you do anything other than browse the internet.","positive":0},{"review":"  Keeps my laptop which is prone to overheating cool.Occasional horrendous noises.Feels a bit bulky.A must for my particular laptop but I'm sure other coolers might do a better job.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this product in July last year (about 15 months ago.) It worked really well, helped a lot with bringing my laptop's temp down. Which was probably a precursor to the issue I've now had, where it simply won't power on at all any longer.For the price, it did the job surprisingly well while it lasted, but if I were looking to buy it now, I'd want to know it may not be a long-term investment.","positive":0},{"review":"  It doesn't make the setup quiet.  Just quieter (and cooler).The USB cable cable it comes with could be quite a bit shorter, but then I guess it wouldn't fit as many laptops as well.  I could also do without the extra red lighting or at least an off switch for it, but it's not very bright when your laptop covers it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an extremely great laptop fan, even for non-gamers. I owned the 3-fan blue LED Havit but gave it to a family member to use on a much older and struggling laptop -that fan was superb and survived after being dropped a few times.5\" laptop covers nearly the entire base surface. Those using a smaller PC may notice more bleeding light from the sides.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had an older laptop cooling fan that was an incredibly stupid design with a cord too short to reach the other side of my older laptop's usb slot. I bought the HAVIT 5-fans cooler fan. It is an excellent design, the quietest laptop fan I've ever had, stable, and the legs that lift up the HAVIT are solid - not pieces of junk that easily break like other fans I've had in the past. I highly recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this cooler since it was well reviewed and also for it's size. I needed something I could put my 17 inch touchscreen laptop and provide some stability.Overall I am happy with my purchase. I do have one thing for the con's list, the dial to turn the fan speed up or down just feels cheap although it works fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a nice quiet lap desk for laptops.  The only problem is that I have one smaller lap desk with fewer fans that move more air than this one.  I also like the plugs on the right side of the product and not on the back side.  I am returning this and purchasing one that may be a better fit for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this cooling pad back in 2016 and I am still using it. So lets start from the beginning.If you are going to use this often and for gaming definitely make sure you clean dust at least every week.Other than that yes 10 10 just buy it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great and has never failed me over the last two months.  I am using it, believe it or not, as a source of cool air under an HP Elite desktop PC, inside of a four-shelf network center in my home, and it just keeps on running.  Does exactly what it's built to do, even in this unusual setup.  Well done, HAVIT peeps.","positive":1},{"review":"  I want to preface by saying this is NOT a alternative if you need a new internal fan or if you have extreme over-heating issues. What this is great for is if you have a laptop (like mine (lots of Acer users here lol)) that is prone to over heating due to poor ventilation. Between the fact that this is a prime item, you can get a full refund if it comes damage, andthere is an 18 month warranty, backed with excellent customer service and lifetime tech support, this is definitely the way to go in terms of cooling pads. Hope this helps.","positive":1},{"review":"  so these are kind of a necessity when you have a warm laptop. but im starting to feel like these are more for your lap than your computer. so its not bad. Would buy again.","positive":1},{"review":"  My macbook air was running very hot (fan running on high) with some high demand CPU musical software I was running. I thought I might have to buy a new computer to run this software, but someone suggested I try one of these cooling pads first. Not bad for 25 dollars. Saved me from buying a new computer (for now).","positive":1},{"review":"  I may have had too high of expectations, but it was only able to keep my laptop ~1-3 degrees cooler than not using it. The fans just don't spin fast enough to move enough heat (albeit, my laptop does put off a lot of heat with a GTX1060 inside).Expectations aside, I could have given it 4 stars if one of the fans didn't die after <2 months of use making the ~1-3 degrees go out the window because it was the fan directly under the GPU which is producing most of the heat.Don't expect massive cooling, but if you just need to keep your laptop a little cooler you may have better luck.","positive":0},{"review":"  After reading some of the other reviews here, I bought this thinking it would be able to cool my MSI GL73 laptop a little bit.  Either those reviews are fake or paid for or maybe this works for some laptops but not others like mine.  I see no difference in CPU temperature at load (which for this laptop runs in the 80-90 C range).  Also, the fans make a faint whine which gets annoying after awhile.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not a marvel in electronic engineering but it works and it does what it is supposed to do. After a few months, the fan speed control wheel broke. It's worth the $25.00.","positive":0},{"review":"  Mine came with a chipped off piece of plastic.  So to start the product I got is damaged and defective.  That being said, it does keep my gaming laptop slightly cooler, about 5-10 degrees Celsius and keeps my laptop fans from maxing out all the time.  I suppose a well  made version of this product would be useful.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0They give up the fan speed in order to achieve the low noise level which is really stupid. The fan speed is extremely low, it can barely blow up a piece of tissue paper (as you can see in my video). It might keep your laptop cool if it`s just everyday use, but DEFINITELY NOT GAMING. Do not buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Piece of Junk.  Save your money and steer clear of this brand and cooler that remotely looks like this.  Just say no.  I tossed mine in the trash.","positive":0},{"review":"  Quiet, 3 out of 5 fans worked, later got a forth to work, has a solid lightweight design, wished it had better fans though, will still work on fan 5 (lower right hand), but in the long run my laptop gets hot on the left side and it cools decently.","positive":0},{"review":"  Own a MSI GSX673VRwhen running FPS games i am pegging around 90C degrees - was looking for something to try to cool it down abitBought this - fits perfectly under the laptop , however even with all its fans - did not notice much difference in tempsso - for me - this was not a good purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  Based on reviews here and on YouTube, I tested out this cooling pad for my laptop. It didn't keep my computer cool at all. While it has 5 fans, the blades are small and it really doesn't pick up enough airflow and distribute it as needed. I went back to a Tree New Bee Cooling Pad for a 17\" laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  This worked great at first. The fan was purchased six months ago, and is now losing juice. I purchased the fan because it was a perfect average between review value and price. But in hindsight, I wish I would have invested a bit more money for something that would last longer.","positive":0},{"review":"  I researched the best reviewed cooling pads for laptops on Amazon and this one got the best reviews, so I tried it and I agree that this gets the job done. When it's on full blast, you can hardly hear the fans and the LED lights won't bother you because your laptop will be covering it. I had frame rate problems on my gaming laptop due to overheating but this cooling pad helped fix my problem and no choppiness and frame drops while gaming. Definitely recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am not a heavy gamer so to speak but I play games all night long on the computer, hidden object, bingo easy on the computer.. I don't think the small tabs they supplied would really hold the computer if it was bumped. I do like it and would purchase again.","positive":1},{"review":"  This blew me away. The product, the packaging, everything. HAVIT did a really good job on this product. I am really pleased and I look forward into buying more of their products.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the second best purchase I've ever made. I own a a Lenovo Legion Gaming laptop. The difference between high speed and low speed is minimal. Great product for a gamer laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the price, I've been satisfied so far. I can't speak to longevity but in the days I've been using the cooling pad it's worked well for my purposes. Simple and easy to use and it does the job. No slipping of my laptop even without the holder flipped open.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this cooling pad for my 17\" HP, the only thing that I don't like is it doesn't have a carrying bag to transport it when I travel with the laptop. It is very quiet at all speeds and keeps the computer cool, sometimes I use the fan to aid me in a hot room like a personal fan. One of the base pads kept falling off but I just need to glue it back with gorilla glue or rubber cement. Otherwise it is amazing & well built.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, I like this cooling pad. If you have it set up on a desk, you'll likely experience no problems at all. The only downside is that the fans sometimes get off kilter or something and make an annoying noise. It usually goes away w  some tapping of the cooling pad and doesn't last forever so I don't regret buying it, especially bc its so affordable.","positive":1},{"review":"  My laptop was overheating and thermal throttling my graphics card, making it impossible to play the games I wanted to.I saw this recommended on a forum to help keep the comp cool enough to avoid the thermal throttle (under 90 celsius). Monitoring the temps before and after the fan, it makes about a 15-20 degree celsius difference. That's pretty awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is very light weight and fully made of cheap plastic. However, as long as you aren`t dropping it or beating it up, I`ve had it for a long time and no harm will ever come to it. I found myself using a desk fan in combination with it when I was gaming just to keep it cool. The best feature of this, is that it stands up and puts space for ventilation below your laptop, and does its best to filter the hot air out from under the laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  My gaming laptop was starting to overheat with COD. I was having to lower setting on the graphics cards to stop the screen from distorting.The knobs on the left let you control the fan speeds. Even on high setting, I don't think it is loud.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this not too long ago and unfortunately on the fans stopped working pretty quickly after that. It isn't a bad cooling pad when it works, but unfortunately it has its issues. I doubt I'll be buying another from this brand after returning the one that broke on me.","positive":0},{"review":"  the fans barely move any air. it's almost completely silent, which makes sense, because it doesn't really do anything. So it looks like I paid $20 for a laptop stand with some red LED's. I'd look somewhere else for a proper laptop cooler.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is the 6-month update. It is a good gaming laptop (obviously, with the nVidia GPU). Googled and found that other people have similar issues. Also, the WiFi cannot automatically reconnect after waking up from sleep, even though tried all the software setting   options.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked great, while it worked.. Only used it while gaming as my laptop would start cranking out some heat. The fans were loud, but it moved air pretty well.","positive":0},{"review":"  To be honest, I thought this was the answer to getting that extra 5fps when playing video games - but did not really do much. It did what it was supposed to do (blow air to the bottom of your laptop to prevent it from overheating), but I really can't say that its a must have product. Never dropped it, never moved it, it literally stayed on my desk since my purchase. Try different products to help cool your laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this in April of 2019, fast-forward to January 2020 and it`s so noisy I can`t sleep unless I turn it off completely which is not good because I keep my laptop running all night.. And I haven`t dropped it or anything \u2014 I also regularly dust it daily. Overall, I do not recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this because my laptop runs hot and it causes some stability issues.  So far I've not noticed ANY cooling effect at all. However, it did raise the laptop to a good height.  I've included a before after of the laptop to see how well it raises the screen in general.","positive":0},{"review":"  This worked awesome for about 2 weeks and then one of the fans started making a very loud noise the entire time its on. It sucks because I love the product, and it even has a little lip that keeps your laptop from slipping forward, and the fans work great. I use it on high while gaming, which heats up the lap top of ton, and it cools it down well. The only thing is the very loud constant noise one of the fan now makes after only 2 weeks of having it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Quick Review:Great and worked as advertised until six months in when a part of it broke.Detailed Review:It's extremely light-weight and it worked great at first.HOWEVER, it's only been six months and one of the USB ports (there's two) stopped working, which is really important to the device. I enjoyed it while it lasted but wont be purchasing another one, I'll look elsewhere for a replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked great for 4 months then out of the blue the fabric USB cable turned flakey. But at least it's just the cable.Edit:8 months later and the switch is now flakey. I'll have to replace the switch.","positive":0},{"review":"  As we all know, laptops can tend to run hot.  And older laptops, such as my 5 year Dell, can run even hotter.  I like having the 5 fans, as it gives you good coverage and air flow.  I think I paid around $29 for this, and it was well worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ive had this laptop cooler for about a year now.. Peel off the stickers that cover the center axel pin of each fan and drop in your favorite electronic lube. It is now SILENT, way quieter than it was straight out of the box, brand new.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this specifically because gaming on my laptop seemed to make it too hot and I was worried it would damage itself. Did some research to figure out if these fans actually helped but couldn't get a definite answer. Temps stay in a comfortable range when on, and it's not noisy at all. The extra USB slot on the fan doesn't seem to have enough power to use for charging a phone or something similar so plan to lose a USB on your laptop when in use, but that's only a small gripe.","positive":1},{"review":"  My work computer runs for several hours a day so I wanted a good fan that would keep up and keep it cool. So far things have been working out well.I love that it`s light weight and that it`s power source is the computer, so I don`t have to worry about finding an outlet or batteries.Would definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  At first, I wasn't sure about the pad since the fans seemed to be very low even at max setting.  But it actually does bring down my core temps by a few degrees C. This is to be expected after extensive use I suppose. For the cost, it had a good run so can't really complain.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've only used it for  one day now..\" So is that piece of white foam that was in the box what your are referencing. And what groove of the cooling pad are you talking about where you put them into.","positive":1},{"review":"  I thought it might be a little too big, but it fits perfectly. The five fans help since all the heat is at the back of the laptop. And don't worry about whether you're getting the 'red' or the 'blue' version - you really don't see the light. And yes, you can just hear the fan, but barely.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had a few of these and this one works great under my MSI 15 inch gaming laptop.  It keeps it cool. That happens to all of them. And vacuum the bottom vents on your laptop too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a Lenovo gaming laptop, and no matter what I try, it overheats if I am in a graphics intensive game. I have one fan that can be attached, it works well, but if I can't have it on the bed with me, it must be attached on a hard surface. The colour is fun and it doesn't drain the power faster than the plug can charge it (my other fan did). I recommend this for anyone with a gaming laptop and the red colour is a fun addition.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a very large old 17 laptop that often overheats. This cooler is the perfect size. There is a second USB port on the base to make up for taking the one on your laptop. There are little feet to raise the back of the device which can be helpful as the laptop is raised by about two inches.","positive":1},{"review":"  If it was possible to give this item a zero I would have.  Item was DOA out of the box.  It falls in that price point that it is almost more of a hassle to to return than just learn your lesson and eat the $24.","positive":0},{"review":"  Received the fan last week. Plugged it into my laptop using the attached USB cable.Update: Received replacement product after second attempt to contact them. New product only turns on sometimes, and can take dozens of attempts to turn on.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good job cooling. I like the fan speed adjustments as well.  I am assuming the port I never used may have never worked to begin with.  The one I purchased for my husband's laptop is still working fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works well, nice design. I can definitely tell that my laptop is running cooler now.So if noise isn`t a big deal, it works great and looks good doing it. If you use it in a quieter setting, it may be good for a bit before the fans start to go.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product became noisy within 6 months after purchase.  While the fans worked as expected, noise increased markedly over time. By the end of two years it became unusable due to noise issues though it continued to cool.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you're going to use this for a gaming laptop DON'T BUY ITFirst of all the fans are really weak and barely put any air flow in my laptop (Even on table) at max even tho I realized that this can only go up to 1100 RPM while the one on my Acer Predator can do 6000 MAX RPMEven when I playing games it still doesn't do anything at all I also realized that it built so much dust on the fans I had to clean them out 2 times a week to make sure it isn't damaging the Fans but sadly it did anyway I found out that one of the top fans are becoming slow.","positive":0},{"review":"  Within just a couple days one of the fans starting making a loud whirring grinding noise. It's been five months and it just gets worse. Even when it's not making that horrible racket it's very loud even on the lowest setting. The fans are quite strong and generate a lot of cool air but I wouldn't buy it again because of the noise.","positive":0},{"review":"  Received this product and, right out the box, when connected to my PC, it does not turn on at all. Really renders it only useful to prop my computer up off my bed, which was the main reason I bought it, but considering it's a gaming PC and I do a lot of gaming it's unfortunate that I'm only left with a 25 dollar laptop prop and not something to help cool it down more. Tried everything I could to get it to work, but no dice.","positive":0},{"review":"  USB cord stopped working where the cord meets the connector. Didn't really make my gaming laptop any cooler as I was still reaching high temperatures with my i7 and 1060gtx. Helps just to have it as a riser so the laptop isn't suffocating itself,  but doesn't really help the temperatures otherwise. I have an Asus Rog Strix Scar Edition.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought item and then fans worked for about 3-4 weeks.  Afterwards, the 4 fans in the corners stopped working, and the middle one needed a jump start to work (blow on it to get it moving, then it'll spin on it's own.  Would not recommend.I guess there is a 1 year warranty but this was such a terrible product that I would not waste any additional time messing with getting something back for the 25 dollars I wasted.","positive":0},{"review":"  I did not buy this for gaming, but for working with BIM Architectural software, doing high resolution computer graphics. It works great. Also the USB chord is short and the port is on the opposite side from my computer USB port, so I use it upside down and cannot use the legs and the ledge that holds the computer in place. (I use an HP Pavilion) All in all, it does what I need, just could use a few more design modifications to be universally used by all computers.","positive":1},{"review":"  so far I am going to give this a 5 star ( have only had this for month and a half) it is not loud at all even fully turned up. I have only had a need to use 1 USB port for the power between it and my PC. It helps to keep my new laptop in place with out fear that when I tilt my portable PC stand that my computer may shift and fall. I would buy this again and do recommend it for larger style laptops (mine is a 17\").","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great little system which is both as effective as it is aesthetically pleasing.  The red light provides a gaming ambiance while the fans adequately cool your lap top or gaming device.  Yep, we were so impressed by this that we bought a second one to keep our Xbox from overheating.  This is a great value, and since buying them we`ve had no issues (over 6 months for one, and a year for the first we bought).","positive":1},{"review":"  I'll keep it short.OVERALL A+. Really nice for longer sessions. But will help no matter how long you use it for.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have an Asus with a bizarre vent system (it vents right at the hinge of the lid.) so I was struggling to find a way to cool my laptop appropriately for games. It runs so quietly I can barely hear it, and the lights aren't super bright annoying. I had no problems getting it going and it has really made a difference for my laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Although I have a gaming laptop it gets quite hot during gaming. I had a dual-fan cooling pad earlier that didn't do much at all max 3-4 degrees but this one really does the job. The only downside is that it vibrates a little bit on max fan speed. Overall good cooling pad for this price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Have bought 4 of these despite fact that cable connecting fan to laptop tends to stop working quickly.  But love fan so much kept investing in new ones.  Finally occurred to me to contact Havit directly and they have supplied me with new cables for free and now I can use all fans again.","positive":1},{"review":"  My son's laptop was overheating.  He has a multi-screen setup with two graphics cards.  It's still working great.  In fact, it worked so well, that we bought one for our other son's laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  A normal cooling pad, I use an Asus FX503 not a top grade gaming laptop but does what it needs, I usually play Far Cry 4 And Dying Light, and the fan end up taking off like a plane at low settings . So far instead of taking off within seconds of gaming it takes off only when I run the games on moderate settings after about 15-30 minutes.","positive":1},{"review":"  Not sure if this is discontinued, but figured I'd leave a review for mine after one fan finally went out. Overall pretty solid for a cooling pad. But, I'll probably come back to Havit down the road if the new fan isn't worth the price.Overall not going to make your laptop ice cold, but will keep it from catching fire.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product works well in terms of cooling my laptop. The problem is the additional USB drives remain unrecognized by my PC. It's caused me several problems as a result. I probably would opt for something else if I had to make this purchase again.","positive":0},{"review":"  I initially liked this chill pad for my laptop when I purchased it back in May of 2018.  Sadly as of today (August 17), it is no longer working.  Anyone looking to purchase a new chill pad, this is not a good option.I of expected to get longer than four months out of this item, and I'm very disappointed in the quality .","positive":0},{"review":"  So I've been pretty excited about this cooler as I was out of the country when I purchased this, when it arrived I quickly set it up to see if I could start gaming again. Sadly, the results were pretty bad. I get idle temps of 60 degrees C, how much more if I start gaming on my laptop.I rated 5 for portability as it is pretty lightweight.","positive":0},{"review":"  This POS laptop cooler broke within 3 months of purchase . On off switch broke in off position . No way in Hell should that switch fail that soon on new cooling pad.Another cheap product Amazon handles.","positive":0},{"review":"  It literally makes my computer hotter than when it`s not using it, I try to flip it to let the air go the other way but then it just feels like it`s doing nothing....","positive":0},{"review":"  It was good at first, it was pretty cheap but it didn't let my computer overheat though it still got pretty warm, after a month and 5 days the cord doesn't connect, I have to pull the cord one direction and tape it to keep it on. Faulty cord for a near $30 dollar product. I can't return it and I'm not very happy with this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got this cooler at the beginning of Feb this year and it worked okay, my laptop was still reaching like 90C inside. And now the wheel to turn the cooler on and off has broken so I can't turn it on anymore, and the screws are so tight I can't even open it up to try to fix it myself. I paid $24.99 for this and I would say try to find one that's built better than this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  Five fan model was noisy right out of the box.  Thought the fans were hitting the plastic shroud.  Plastic housing has a cheap feel to it.  Two feet and front lip are sturdy.","positive":0},{"review":"  i bought this (HAVIT 5 Fans Laptop Cooling Pad for 14-17 Inch Laptop, Cooler Pad with LED Light, Dual USB 2.0 Ports, Adjustable Mount Stand (Black) ) from one year and the using was less than normal (not all the time) but when i check it before few days i found one fan stop working, if my use is not heavy duty and one fan stop functioning what will happen if i keep it ON all the time.","positive":0},{"review":"  I unboxed this laptop cooling pad less than 30 days ago, and it just burned out.  Never felt like a cooling surface for my laptop, no cool air produced.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is my second one for another laptop.  These cooler pads by this company are high-rated and deserve that.  Awful.  The fans took care of it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was pleasantly surprised how lightweight this cooling pad is. It's super easy to use and fits my 13\" Macbook pro well. The pad still stays in place just fine, but for how much it costs, it's not a big deal. Extra grip stickers would be nice for this reason.","positive":1},{"review":"  The size is great, and fan placement works for both my personal and work laptops (15\" & 17\").I like the flap that keeps your laptop from sliding off, and the ability to tilt the cooling pad up is terrific. However, with almost daily use since my purchase, the covering of the USB connector is already fraying. That's the only negative to an otherwise great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Here's the deal - THIS IS NOT A BAD REVIEW, but a real world review.  The design around the corners is so gamey techie that the fans are more centralized.  This detracts from the fans' effectiveness in blowing air directly to my SSD and hot section of my Hp Pavilion - thus I normally shift my laptop about 1-2\" to the left, so it sits dirrectly overlop the upper left fan.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like that this pad lays flat and has the tab to keep my laptop stable if I do choose to slant it. I once owned a cooling pad that was built on a slant and had no tabs to hold it in place. The only con I can think of at the moment is that I wish there was an option to turn off the red led lights when the cooling pad is in use. The lights are unnecessary and can be annoying, especially at night.","positive":1},{"review":"  Product works great at providing airflow under your laptop, the fans aren't too fast where it forces air into the laptop, but are just fast enough to circulate air and keep the laptop keyboard surface cool. I remember my laptop being to hot to touch sometimes when playing big games but now it's comfortable. Have not noticed any improvement in PC performance.","positive":1},{"review":"  Has purchased 4 of these HAVIT 5 Fans Laptop Cooling Pad for 14-17 Inch Laptop Coolers, 2 for me, 2 for friends.Have a year's use on 2 Havits without complaint.3ghz w  Samsung SSD 860 Pro.The extra USB port comes in handy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great.. Must buy..","positive":1},{"review":"  1. You can really feel the air coming out and the top mesh becomes cold like car windows in a cold spring night.Identify your laptop heating areas first and then order cooling pads.

I just wouldn't use it in a quiet room with others, unless you don't care about the sound. It's been bent and if it moves a bit it stops the fan from working, so I may just use another one. Not an issue with the fan, just the usb cord.","positive":1},{"review":"  It worked as intended and was relatively okay with what you got. Main problem was that after about a month of usage, the ports didn't work right and the mouse kept disconnecting. Also after about three months of usage the dial to control speed just wore down and literally fell out. Essentially at this point (I bought in october) it's a large chunk of unusable plastic as I can't control the speed and it doesn't connect properly, but while it worked, it worked fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  In my experience this wasnt putting out enough air to actually have an effect. My computer didn't even see 2-3 degrees Fahrenheit difference. Just a really awkward device to set your laptop on.","positive":0},{"review":"  The wheel that controls the fans on this product just broke off exactly 31 days after purchase\u2026 One day after the return window closed. I barely touched the thing besides keeping it on my desk.","positive":0},{"review":"  This worked for a couple of weeks but I didn't return it because it was still good to hold on my lap. Too big to fit into laptop bag. Not thrilled about it not working anymore, either.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this product for a new laptop and it performed as described for about half a year. Then the fan noise progressively increase to the point now it sounds like a jackhammer when it gets to full speed. I've inspected it several times and cannot find any reason for the noise such as dirt or objects in the blades. I would be reluctant to purchase this brand again as it did not hold up to just sitting on a desk.","positive":0},{"review":"  I would have given it more stars if the power switch didn't go out after just a couple of months. luckily It was on full when it failed. Still works just have to unplug it from usb to turn it off.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0so disappointed. Even the 7 dollars cooler pad in Fry`s is made by metal, but this one is plastic...","positive":0},{"review":"  I realize it is out of warranty, but HAVIT support has refused to respond to emails requesting assistance with a fix.  On the HAVIT website they brag about their \"World Class support Techs\" and how they will provide support for most fixes.  Product support is lousy.  Too bad, as my wife really likes the cooling fan.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this unit to keep my work laptop from overheating, which it did a lot for some reason.  The fans were super quiet at first and it was doing it's job.  After about a month of use, the fans make a lot rattling noises.  Very annoying while trying to work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I didnt have a chance to test the unit until today, and I can say DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS. I tried connect the USB to both ports, thinking I had the wrong one and neither of them work.Build quality is what you would expect:  a cheap plastic material with questionable durability. In the process of returning.","positive":0},{"review":"  Less noise on max speed than the laptops fans, moves a solid amount of air and seems decently built. small amount of plastic bend, but only if you get both hands on it and go looking for the flex.If I ever get time to do a temp test on this setup I will update my review, but so far I've been able to grind intense games and be able to pick up the laptop and go without much heat on the chassis.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love my computer, but it was literally burning my thighs. This platform is nearly silent and saves both my thighs and my computer from undue wear and tear. Also, has a usb port to make up for the one it uses, so you don't have to go without another peripheral.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this instead of other, more highly rated cooling pads because it matches my Omen's color scheme, but the fans are a lot louder than I expected. I'm talking about bearing noise, not wind noise. Can't hear them over the jet turbine that is my laptop's internal fan though, and even less so when you have a headset headphones on.It keeps the laptop 10-15c cooler than before, though, so I'm forgiving the fan noise.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this cooling fan for four and a half months. It has worked as expected. That's great customer service..","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great device to keep your laptop cool. I got it for my Omen laptop and it keeps the heat down almost completely. This really works. I will say that I start it as soon as I turn on my laptop for gaming and never turn it off but it works great.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sturdy. works well, keeps my laptop about 5-10 degrees cooler under load on average. you dont see the red, but it is cool because red is cool which makes the air cooler and thats the entire point. I will not apologize for the dadjoke in the title.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this product at all times while the laptop is running. I use it to play games, stream, and do some work with iso's 7zip, etc. Fairly quiet. Could provide more airflow in my opinion, but, works as advertised.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am using this to cool an old Lenovo T410s laptop. The laptop used to shutdown caused by overheating, but since i started using this cooling pad, the overheating stopped. It is very sturdy, i can use it on a table and on my lap. I'll buy this again.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's doing the job it was designed to do, I use my laptop like a desktop most of the time, so it runs constantly. The fan in on a shelf above the monitor with the laptop on top of it. I have it set to run at the highest speed (the room is warm) and it's almost silent. And I like that I can adjust the height of the back so that when I use the laptop as a laptop (when I travel) it gives the keyboard a better angle.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this cooler almost 2 years. My laptop is ALWAYS on, 24 7. It is getting a little noisy now, so I will be buying another one soon. For the price it is a good deal.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my second HAVIT laptop cooler. I bought the slim version with 3 fans and I like it a lot. It is also louder. I still like it though, but not as much as the slim version.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great product until it got noisy with only 2 months usage.  No way to reach seller to exchange so I bought a Targus.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great fan for the price. Very quiet and the lighting is actually quite subtle which I like. I leave my computer on a lot so I was afraid it might affect sleep since I keep my computer in my bedroom.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall, this was an okay looking product and the build quality was what you'd expect given the price.  Plasticky but seems well built.  Overall, this is a solid product (if yours works properly) and provides plenty of airflow as long as you don't need to connect a USB 3.0 device through it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Out of the box one of the fans was not working. It looks OK for a $16 product but I was hoping for at least to work properly for a week.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not really bringing my temps down like I hoped. Works well enough as a barrier between the hot bottom of the laptop and my lap, but that's about it. The USB is also super loose. Lights are a nice touch.","positive":0},{"review":"  My computer is aged, so it doesn't have the best temps when it comes to gaming. When I got this, I hoped it would help keep temps a bit lower on CPU GPU intensive games. I noticed zero notable change in temp, nor any difference in internal fan speed, nor any difference in CPU throttling.It looks nice, and only makes a moderate amount of noise, but it ultimately doesn't perform.","positive":0},{"review":"  Didn't do anything.","positive":0},{"review":"  Seems to work great, 5 fans blowing on the bottom of my Lenova, just chillin .. Product update, 3 months after purchase, all but one of fans quit working. Removed screen, spun fans, 4 will not work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I order this item for my sons' gaming laptop because it has 5 fans and he like that the LED lights matched the ones in his laptop. It arrived a day later than anticipated, and it doesn't cool the gaming computer as much as he thought it would so he had to add a separate little fan on his desk to help with keeping it cool.","positive":0},{"review":"  For $30, this is a great fan array that will keep a high performance laptop out of overheating danger.  Ignore the reviewers complaining about the slide-switch breaking.  If one is buying this fan array because one wants top cooling performance, then one will not have any need to constantly play with the slide-switch because one will simply leave it at the highest setting and enjoy better laptop performance.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have bought two of these fans because I am a little rough on them. Still using the first one after a year, good tough durable product. If you have a fan broke in your computer as I do, this was a great alternative to paying a computer repair place big bucks to fix it. My computer never overheats now with this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've only had this for a few days, but it's working great for me. The fan sound is super quiet and only noticeable if everything is completely silent (Whatever game you're playing would drown out ten of these). Idk why people wouldn't get one. It's the extra push that your computer might need.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a refurbished HP 20XX and the fan is starting to quit. So much so that my computer warns me it can't work anymore because the conditions are too hot.just in case. But for now, game unpaused.","positive":1},{"review":"  My gaming ASUS ROG laptop used to heat up to 80 degrees C while gaming, now it barely gets over 50 degrees with this cooling pad. It's nice and convenient to use on a desk and I can plug in my mouse to the cooling pad, and plug the pad into my laptop so I save USB space for other devices. Great Product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the second unit I purchased. The first was for my company laptop which feels hot after several hours. My personal laptop is a an older Sony Vaio, that also heat up with usage. I like that you can adjust the speed of the fans as well as you can adjust the unit to tilt at the back.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this cooling pad for my 15-inch gaming laptop. During serious gaming sessions, it has been helpful in keeping temperatures within moderate ranges (55-70 C). that helped reduce some of the neck pain. Note: it says adjustable height in the images, but in reality it's just a pair of foldable legs which incline the pad laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Amazing laptop cooler. I cant say for sure how well ALL the fans work, but the upper most two definitely help direct air into my laptop cooling fans for better air flow. Love the colors in it and how quiet this is. Couldn't be happier.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this for my MacBook Pro (mid 2012) which would constantly overheat due to the tax on the machine from video rendering as I use it to edit simple videos for youtube content with Adobe Premier. I typically sit in bed with my computer on my lap which obviously would cause it to get very hot however this device seems to keep it completely cool. I purchased it knowing it only had one port (after using the other to connect it to your computer) for USB extension so I don't want this to be seen as a complaint but rather a suggestion for future models. But overall it is a great device.","positive":1},{"review":"  Product is fantastic. Very quiet, almost inaudible actually, lightweight and ergonomic. You have to manually shut it off, and, since it`s so quiet, I can`t tell you how many times I`ve shut down my laptop only to forget the fans were on and have them running for days on end. Other than that though I don`t have any problems with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Let's start from the beginning.  I take it out of the box and place my 17\" screen laptop on it.  Flat out, its junk.  Dont buy it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've been using this laptop cooler for a few weeks and sorry to say, it does not work very well.  Fans spin but they don't  move much air.  The area around my laptop exhaust is as hot as  it ever was.  The RPM control knob does nothing besides turning the cooler and lights on and off.","positive":0},{"review":"  Literally on the third day of using this, the top right fan stopped working. Contacted them for a replacement and haven't replied back in 4 days...","positive":0},{"review":"  Held a piece of string in front of fans wouldn't even lift it off the mesh at max speedHeld a piece of thin paper in front of fans wouldn't even lift it off the mesh at max speedcore temp software--> after and before---> zero change.dont buy this item.what a waste of money..","positive":0},{"review":"  Too loud for me. The fans have an annoying sound to them. Wish I bought a different cooling pad.","positive":0},{"review":"  It worked for 16 months then quit.  While it worked it worked well..CHEAP.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this to add more cooling for my MacBook Pro while editing. One of the fans makes a ridiculous amount of noise. It down help keep the laptop cool and cost is pretty on point. To make this a bit better I had to take it apart re-enforce the plastic housing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not much else to say. It worked fine for the first few weeks, but then it wouldn't power on any more. I tried multiple USB ports and no luck.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broke less than a year and there isn`t a company contact number .","positive":0},{"review":"  Fan speeds don't make a big difference, expected way more out of this product.At least is useful to keep my laptop off of a flat surface.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a really neat product, fans work well, lights are lit, and it isn't noisy sometimes I can't even tell if it's on or not lol. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I have a 17in laptop and it just barley fits flush on top of the fan. So, if you have a 17in laptop maybe look for something a little bigger.","positive":1},{"review":"  Have a Dell Precision 7330 that would get really hot sitting on my deck running all day.  At the end of the day would pick it up and you could feel the heat.  After getting and using this you notice a much cooler laptop.  It's quiet about the same noise level as the built in laptop fan, and a lot quieter then when those internal fans a re running full.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought one to try out and was so pleased with it, I bought a second one for my grandson. The fans are very quiet, I dont even hear them running. I have a large 17\" laptop and it fits nicely, the fans keep it cool when I'm working on my laptop. My grandson uses his laptop primarily for gaming and says the fans do a great job of keeping his laptop cool.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have the ROG GL702VM and with this I litterally drop no degrees on my CPU, GPU, and only a few degrees on the Mainboard (Fahrenheit). It looks well designed and honestly looks pretty. Going from 30 frames to well over 90. I strongly recommend using a phone charger connected to it rather than the cord it comes with as it wont make your laptop power it, saving energy.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's only been three weeks and the fans already stopped working :(. The Lights stay lit up though.. Unlike MANY others on Amazon.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have an HP Pavilion Touchsmart laptop. I have never been happy with the fan inside.https:  www.amazon.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great looking product, very light and minimalist packaging. The product preview image is very true to life. It does keep the laptop cool with ventilation but it doesn't suit MY specific needs but it does for my room-mate. I would definitely recommend this product as a starter.","positive":1},{"review":"  Doesn't have that annoying high pitched sound like some do therefore it is a winner in my book.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is exactly what I was looking for. It's nice it has a little bulk so it doesn't feel cheap and flimpsy. It does a great job cooling my laptop and my favorite feature is the the lip that flips up so your laptop be doesn't fall off the cooling pad (which was a very annoying problem my old one did).","positive":1},{"review":"  Had an old walmart brand for my Acer, keys would get very hot when gaming and the position of the vents would cause me to have to hang the laptop off the edge to line up the fan. Not anymore with this 5 fan design. Parts are made from plastic but anything more heavy duty probably wouldn't dissipate heat very well. Definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  Not sure if I`m missing something or I got a bad product, but the pad barely has any fan speed. My MSI laptops fan on basic mode out performs this pad on its max setting. It matches my laptop and together they look great. Ultimately I will be left swapping this out for a new one or a different model.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good for normal everyday use. Loud, as expected. Not recommended for gaming since speed is about as fast as laptops fans but better than if the exhaust fans were covered.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm chasing my laptop all over this board. Cools great but even with the \"stay in place strip it just continually slides.","positive":0},{"review":"  Enjoyed this, and it worked well while it worked. Fan has now stopped working. For the number of times that I have used this, would not expect it to quit working. One expects better performance for the price paid.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not bad pad. But it decreasing the temperature just a little bit.","positive":0},{"review":"  Having major loose usb connections, like the usb has a short wiggle it til it works kinda think I love the pad but the usb ports didn't last long... anyone have one similar that they can recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  The aesthetics of this cooling pad are great.. I`ve had the product for less than a year - and used it even less than that, but somehow the bearings have already failed. Would not purchase again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Screwed up my new computer, stopped turning, burned out everything connected to it.","positive":0},{"review":"  USB ports sort of loose when I plug them in. Tried a lot of different USB devices all were losses fitting on this product. Fans rattle a little bit at low and high speeds.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not good for a true gaming laptop as the fans spin to slow. 5 fans are nice but if the RPM is to low it is no good.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you have a large or older laptop like mine. You know they get hot and start to slow down. Again I wish I would have invested in one of these pads sooner. Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  For about $25 dollars this cooling pad has kept my ASUS ROG STRIX laptop 10-15 degrees cooler (celsius) for the last 6 months. Had it running on my laptop's usb port for the first 4 or 5 months and that wore out the port so I now have it plugged into a wall charger.I can't do a half star, but 4.5 would be my exact rating.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall good colling pad. Since there is not a big choise of pads with red lights, I was looking for pad for my Helios 300 (red one) and color was main reason to buy this. 15.3' Laptop fits good, there is also support for laptop included.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this fan. My internal fan went out on my laptop so it heats up pretty quickly. Keeps it cool. It's quiet and the USB ports come in handy.","positive":1},{"review":"  14\" size is just right for my 13\" laptop. Fits in my carry bag, previously reviewed, just right. Extra USB ports also nice to have. Lights are cute but not really that helpful nor are they annoying with most of the fan surface covered by the laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent product. Makes a huge difference in terms of heat. Games that used to make my Alienware M17 run warm hot to the touch run smoothly. Cool to touch after a few hours of play.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am pleased that Havitt sent me a new one promptly (within 1 week after contacting Havit Direct). I purchased 2 fans. I am an sure how long these fans lasts though. Couple of years.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this cooling pad.  It fits my 17 inch Dell laptop perfectly and holds it in place - doesn't slip at all.  This cooling pad is very good quality and sturdy.  It's exactly what I was looking for.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was honestly one of the \"coolest\" (pun intended ) purchases I've ever made online. Simple, easy to use, and the packaging was wonderful. I wanted it more to keep my laptop off the counter, in case a drink spilt. The fans are so strong I have considered taking it to the range to help cool off my guns between shot groups.","positive":1},{"review":"  - Quiet- Adjustable Fan Speeds- Extra USB slot- Powered by USB port.- Stands underneath to adjust height.- Flip-up stand for computer fitment.","positive":1},{"review":"  After ~5 months of use (abouth 2-5h  week) 2 fans already not working, it is breaking down one by one.It's not loud but if you are speaking with someone online, loudness can cause some discomfort level.It was working pretty good, laptop temperatures decreased. But atleast mine cooling pad wasn't that healthy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got for ex-girlfriend`s son he says it works good.","positive":0},{"review":"  Hated this.  Moving and will give it away.  My guess is that it works great for a guy and probably good forcooling.","positive":0},{"review":"  Paid extra $5 to have it delivered on May 4. Not delivered until May 5. Fans are weak and barely blow any air. Will not be buying from this seller again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Didn't work for me. Have a Lenovo y510p and this thing just isn't strong enough unfortunately. Otherwise it seems to be quiet and the extra usb port is nice.

They didn`t include the usb cable...","positive":0},{"review":"  Didn't really cool my laptop, but looks nice ...","positive":0},{"review":"  Laptop overheated bad with this had to prop up with two styrofoam one of ether side of my computer so it wouldn`t over heat it`s allll bad :(.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've only had this for a month and it already has a short in the wire.

The fans are super quiet I was surprised of how cool they kept the laptop. The lights don`t bother me at all because they are always covered by the laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Wow. I didn't expect this to work as well as it does. Super impressed. My lap actually is a little chilly now.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does what it was made to do. But the biggest plus was the pass-through USB connection. You have to power it via a USB port, but it also has a port, so you can plug your mouse into the cooling pad. Good design.","positive":1},{"review":"  the product is as described....","positive":1},{"review":"  My 15.6 hp omen fit perfectly. No big deal to me, all the fans I've used before didn't even give an extra usb port. I could have bought one with 4 ports, but the reviews were the best for this one, and I'm happy with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my child to keep their new computer cool when gaming.  It is super quiet and keeps the computer cool.  The option to have it tilt is really great and even though you can't see the lit up fans when the computer is on it they look really cool.  I would recommend this for anyone that has a gamer and needs extra cooling to keep the computer running and prevent heat damage.","positive":1},{"review":"  Feels a little on the cheap side on quality but since it sits underneath my laptop it doesnt bother me much. Cools very well and the ergonomics are good too. Fan noise is minimal but adjustable and does its job. Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this for Kiddo's gaming laptop. His laptop gives off a lot of heat, so I got a fan to cool it down. I read some reviews, this one popped up several times, so I bought it. Kiddo likes the red, the fans seem well-placed, and they've been vrooming along quietly and well since this was plugged in.","positive":1},{"review":"  My MSI 17.3 laptop rest on it good.  I only use the fans while playing games.  Only con is that it only comes with two hubs.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this cool pad for several reasons. First, it has back legs so I can change the angle of my laptop. Well done on this cool pad. Definitely worth the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  My laptop still overheated with this cooling pad on full power.I have a Razor Blade Pro 15' Ive used a friends cooling pad, whos cooled my laptop just fine.

The wheel to adjust the fan power stopped working altogether within about 4 months. Cheap plastic.","positive":0},{"review":"  It seems like the fans are balanced wrong, and it is flimsy. After a few weeks it is noisy and unusable.","positive":0},{"review":"  Solid build quality and keeps your laptop elevated, but the fans are useless.","positive":0},{"review":"  Junk - wrong color and does not work properly.","positive":0},{"review":"  It does a decent job cooling, but my laptop is 9 years old and it doesn't keep it from overheating, so it needs a bit more power.

Try a different one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had it for 9 months. It worked well when I first had it, but after time the fans make a loud screeching noise even on the lowest setting. The fans do work to keep your laptop cool though, but they could be better. I think this is a hit or miss, but you can find something better.","positive":0},{"review":"  What a great laptop for its built quality and performance. But you need to tweak a few things to maximise gaming performance:- Purchase another 8GB memory for dual channel- Set UMA buffer size to be auto in BIOS (this gives 2GB video memory in case it needs).- Install latest AMD and GTX drivers, and upgrade to Windows 1903 latest update that resolved a power option related bug that can limit CPU performance.Enjoy the awesome laptop from ASUS.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall a terrific value for a gaming laptop.

Go with AMD all the way, you cannot beet the performance for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  I gotten the Gtx 1650|256 SSD|Ryzen 5 3550H Version I gotta say It's a very good price to performances considering it's a laptop that's not breaking the bank too much. The GTX 1650 is a Good budget card to play all the latest games in Medium-High settings in 1080p. I'm quite surprised that they kept the price this low considering you get a 1080p 120Hz Screen,Rbg keyboard,GTX1650, and a Ryzen Processor. A couple of things I dislike is the storage it's only 256gb that's not gonna cut, most likely you're gonna have to buy an HDD or another SSD and also the mousepad isn't that great but it works and also the speakers aren't that amazing so don't expect great audio lastly the battery life isn't that great don't expect to gaming for more than 2-3 hours.","positive":1},{"review":"  GTX 1650. Ryzen 5, Vega 8.), but I have yet to try the new Modern Warfare which I have just bought and other more graphically demanding games.The thing that bothers me the most about this laptop is that on certain surfaces, it slides, but that might just be my desk since it seems to work fine on others.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop arrived on my doorstep on February 9th, 2020 and had no issues out of the box. I plugged it into my monitor, plugged a keyboard and mouse in, and downloaded the Resident Evil 2 remake.

All in all, I can comfortably recommend this laptop to others after over 6 months.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great all around laptop, good for casual gaming and great for work.My only dislike is the FX505DT doesn't have a USB C port so adding a docking station becomes a challenge. I bought a 144hz monitor to go with this and can only send a 120hz signal to it. Not great if you intend to use this as both a desktop AND laptop but as a stand alone laptop it is outstanding, especially at the $700 price point.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall this is an excellent entry level gaming laptop. It has played all the games I want at Med - High settings at 1080 P with no issue. My only issue is the track pad. I'm not sure if it is the surface or drivers, but it lags and is sometimes totally unresponsive.","positive":1},{"review":"  Prior to this computer I had an ASUS gaming laptop that was 3 times the price of this one.

Let's start with the good. Don't get this thing. If you want a second computer just dedicated to CASUAL gaming, this works for the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  I must be honest. I purchased this Laptop From The Amazon Warehouse for $487. Well if you already have a decent Desktop Gaming Rig, and need a portable solution on the cheap - then yes, this is a viable addition. But if this will be your MAIN gaming rig, I'd give it an hard pass, unless you can get it for the price that I did.","positive":0},{"review":"  The worst laptop I ever had the misfortune of sharing my life experience with. Imagine, imagine making a laptop that doesn't allow you to use the Fn top row keys. Seriously. Like, really.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've never hated a laptop before, but this thing is absolutely terrible. It's a source of frustration every single time I use it. steer very far clear of it.Personally, I'm really looking forward to smashing it into tiny bits with a sledgehammer after I buy a replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  Half the time I booted this computer the mouse and keyboard functionality stopped working.

The keyboard light every time i restet or turn on my laptop it gets to it original setting wish is flashing mode and it is anoying. Also the mause pad feels a litle loose and it makes a weird sound, keyboard is flexible. Also other thing i hate is the brighnes of the screen is very poor and the speaker are the worst i have seen on a laptop they are located on the sides and since you look at the screan from the center of course it is not loud enough.","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all, the 120Hz display makes a world of difference. After 5 years of 120Hz desktop displays, 60Hz displays look stuttery and slow. The battery life is bad, the screen doesn't have popping colours like a 2 thousand dollar macbook and its not superlight, but thats not why I bought it, I have an ipad for word processing , watching videos and emails. If you want a solid gaming laptop at an amazing price I cannot recommend anything else- the 120hz screen really is a rarity at this price point.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is great for gaming. It is a hefty laptop but it`s not meant for travel as much as gaming. And for the price point this got me exactly what I needed. Paying up to $400 more to move to an i7 was just not worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  i did alot of comparisons of laptops before i ordered the asus fx505dt and it did not disapoint. the laptop is thicker and tougher then i initially realized which is a bonus since im a bit of a cluts when it comes to handling stuff.4ghz to 4ghz based on system load. it is an awsome laptop and the only downfall is the ram it definitly needs more then 8gb i recomend if you buy one to get a 8gb ram chip or higher for it when possible.","positive":1},{"review":"  With a couple upgrades this thing rocks. If you are coming from a console you will be very impressed.Have achieved 120+ fps on all my games at 1080 high to very high settings (Rocket league, fortnite, GTA V).I did allot of research before buying and I think you cannot find a better value gaming laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  The battery life when gaming is eh, but when not gaming, the battery life is great. You have to plug the laptop in to get better gaming performance, but when plugged in, it's really good. Hibernate does the same thing as sleep, but in a lower power state. Overall the gaming experience is great, the battery could be better but is still alright, and the sleep mode (especially if on hibernate) is amazing.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this laptop because it is a mid-range gaming laptop and can play most DX11 - DX 12 games with ease on moderate settings. Its not by far high end but the specs are nice. Additonally this laptop does come with dual graphics, It has AMD's Vega 8 and Nivida Discrete just FYI. Overall excellent laptop for anyone and I recommend it fully.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this to replace a Surface Pro 3 with something that could do more gaming, had a conventional form factor and fit my budget and it does well. The first thing I did, though, was upgrade the RAM to 16GB and the nVME to 1TB.For example, I've successfully played, at max settings, Conan Exiles, Elder Scrolls Online and Pathfinder Kingmaker. Most of what I play, though, is stuff like The Sims 4, Cities Skyline, Battletech and Planet Coaster where even low-mid discrete graphics, a not-crap CPU and plenty of storage is more than enough for even high settings.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just Buy it, you cant beat the price build quality performance.Screen is beautiful, full HD 120hz and very bright.  Make sure your power settings are set on \"High performance\", and make sure you are plugged into power.  If this doesn't fix the issue.","positive":1},{"review":"  In short, a Great laptop for the time when it was released if you can get this laptop on sale for like 500-600 bucks BUY IT.If you are familiar with Laptops and tech in general you will know that Laptops lose performance over time as they age and with harder to run games that release, this is one of three PC's that I own and I would much rather play games on my mini itx or my mid tower pc as far as performance goes but as far as mobility and for my needs when I'm out and about, this is a great laptop and it gets the job done.2. This Laptop is far better than a standard laptop that only has integrated graphics.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an amazing entry level gaming laptop. It performs well with emulators. Keep that in mind when purchasing this laptop. Other than those, this is a great value for the money that won't break the bank.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this because I wanted a laptop with a lighted keyboard. This one claimed to have a military grade keyboard with a choice of keyboard colors and light levels. Sometimes when I connect an HDMI cable to a television, I don't get any sound on the television and it stays on on the laptop. I don't know why the settings keep changing and it doesn't happen on my old laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like this laptop a lot for playing games, including on high graphics settings. The problem is that it seems to be very unreliable.If you are savvy with computers and are patient enough to take care of a laptop as needed, this is a great budget gaming option. I do not recommend this laptop for anyone looking to use it as a primary device or someone who is not experienced enough with computers to know how to fix it when it stops working.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Pros: price for the performance you get is quite good. Not great but definitely above average. I'd rather have a 75hz monitor that has no ghosting than this.

So video will be posted up on YouTube once this gets resolved. Maybe saving you time and hassle.","positive":0},{"review":"  I should have known there was a catch for the price point and options of this laptop. if I would have known the only pro this laptop has against my FOUR YEAR OLD GAMING LAPTOP was the graphics, I wouldn't have wasted my money.it's appropriate to assume this is just a basic laptop with nice graphic capabilities on which you must cycle mega games you'd like to play if you want space to do ANYTHING ELSE on the laptop. I would not call this an official gaming laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall i am satisfied by the TUF FX505DT.  In almost every aspect it meets or exceeds my expectations..FOUR TIMES today before it worked.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really enjoying this laptop for doing telework.  I got the ASUS TUF Gaming thinking the Mil Spec and all the enhanced cooling were going to help make it robust.  I doubt it would survive gaming.  I really wanted to like this laptop too.","positive":0},{"review":"  I primarily bought this brand new laptop on March 23rd to do schoolwork and artwork during quarantine. It hasn't been a full month yet, and I've been getting freezing and blue screens of death every couple days.Considering how integral these graphics drivers are to this laptop, and since that was a big reason why I bought it, I'm really disappointed.

It is worth noting, I just received this in the mail 4 hours ago.","positive":1},{"review":"  Right after unboxing, I tried playing Mass Effect Andromeda on this machine (officially recommended GTX 1060). I did not measure the FPS, but it was \"playable\" at ultra graphic. Now that my laptop is maxed-out, it works like a dream. I wouldn't want to live with it in the stock condition, though.","positive":1},{"review":"  First off do not listen to the bad reviews, I bought this laptop with extra 8gig samsung ram and a 2 tb fire cuda hard drive for fast storage on the cheap around 80$. I have this hooked up to a 4k tv using wireless keyboard mouse and a couple xbox controllers. I know not a fair comparison how about my house rig it's sitting next to i built Ryzen 5 3600 32 gigs of ram and a Sapphire Nitro RX 590 graphics card 8gigs vram.  This little laptop can fool me when using it that i'm using my big rig, I've yet to experiment with 4k settings but with the laptops amount of vram i don't think it will do well even my desktop rig struggles at 4k gaming.","positive":1},{"review":"  UPDATE: La mejor recomendaci\u00f3n que les puedo dar con un procesador Ryzen es utilizar RAM EN DUAL CHANNEL, el rendimiento mejor\u00f3 en casi un 50% en fps en juegos.Lleg\u00f3 antes y todo perfecto, los altavoces no son los mejores pero considerando que casi siempre utilizo aud\u00edfonos no es un problema para mi, es r\u00e1pida, buen price y discreta.La recomiendo.","positive":1},{"review":"  So my gf's laptop was beginning to fail on her. She'd had her old one for roughly five years and some of the games she wanted to play simply don't work on intergrated intel graphics. For a purely cosmetic complaint, I would have really liked to see multi-area lighting support on the keyboard.Overall, if you're looking at purchasing this laptop, I'd say the price to performance just can't be beat right now besides my above complaints.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed another laptop in the house with my kids needing computer time due to COVID, so I decided to treat myself a little and get one that had a bit more performance than my previous ASUS which I handed down. I've had it since March now and so far so good. So overall, a solid system for my purposes. For heavier gaming, especially as my kids get older, I'll get a desktop.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I purchased this laptop I immediately ordered an additional 8GB stick of memory, bringing the total to 16GB and also adding dual channel. I also ordered a 1TB SSD to add as a second drive since the 256GB M. I am now getting between 600 and 700mbps which is fantastic.All in all, I recommend the laptop \"if\" you have some technical ability and don't mind doing a little bit of troubleshooting and possibly upgrading the WiFi adapter.","positive":1},{"review":"  Played Outer Worlds on Ultra Quality without a problem. Battery lasts easily for 4-5 hours when working on papers for college..screen was fine still runs perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  Getting this up and running is a total bitch.

As long as the fan don't crap out like on my HP years ago after 1.4 years later.","positive":1},{"review":"  It took too long to ship, it arrived with screen issues including extreme light bleed and a stuck pixel. I sent it to the Asus support center to fix it, it took two entire weeks to be finished, and the new screen still has massive light bleed, they didn't fix the fan, and they even forgot to plug in the audio cable, as I had to open the laptop and reconnect it.This was an awful experience to boot, and Amazon refused to provide any assistance or help in returning the laptop.Avoid unless near repair center or capable of free returns.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I first got this laptop, I had just gotten a decent paycheck so I wanted something to just game on for basic games, mostly Black Ops 3 and Minecraft and stuff like that. At the time, this laptop was a bit cheaper than what it apparently is being sold for now.With the latency issue, playing games with friends is impossible, as both Discord and any game I play on it for multiplayer purposes lags intensely to unplayability. I wouldn't recommend this product for any long term use, especially at the price point its at now.","positive":0},{"review":"  Initially, I liked this laptop. It worked just fine. I regret that I was personally desperate enough to purchase this to begin with, actually. Really, it wasn't that great of a laptop anyways.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's my first week of usage and I have problems with it already. Unfortunately I can't return it since I got it on Black Friday. Doesn't heat too much though, except the ac adapter. Design looks good.","positive":0},{"review":"  Looks Great, Screen is very clear, Keyboard is amazing. BUT, after running a benchmark on a trusted site, This laptop in the 16th percentile compared to others with the exact same components.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm not a hardcore gamer, so as long as it runs games smoothly, I'm usually satisfied.And this does just that.. Again, concerning.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop worked great at first and played everything I wanted it to as expected for its specs. But For the past couple months i have had raising concerns with overheating, reaching max temps of 99 degrees Celcius, and hovering around 90-95 degrees in game. Has happened 6 times now. At first it seemed obvious that it was because of overheating, but not it just happens at random.","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros:-Good looking laptop-Nice display-Plastic shell but tough.Cons:-Right side speaker did not work-Trackpad inconsistent and will stop once in a while.Display looks good, very smooth gaming even on high-ultra settings in most games at 1080p.Keyboard is nice to type on.","positive":0},{"review":"  The Laptop worked alright for playing some new AAA titles such as Warzone. Ran on everything Very Low and Motion Blur Disabled. I wouldn`t suggest buying this Laptop at all. Going through the return process at the moment.","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all it requires a Microsoft account setup, why. Microsoft control freak crap, I tried to use my existing MSFT account but No Way Buddy, make a new one.This wiped out everything accept Windows, I went to ASUS site and downloaded most of what was missing.Track pad is a little cheap feeling but otherwise happy with it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very nice laptop.  I retired my dying 12 year old toshiba for this.  Usually there's noise around so this doesn't matter too much but even putting it on myASUS silent mode(shuts off 1650 and throttles ryzen). it still sounds deafening in quiet places.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this laptop as a whole. If I was to improve upon this, which personally I have. I've had it long enough to leave a review and there ya go. If you want to get into entry level gaming for a laptop, this ones pretty solid.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my wife to replace her 6-year old Asus Zenbook laptop which was starting to do strange things. I figured it would be just as much work to re-install Windows from scratch and her programs and she would still have an old computer. In closing, I like it so much I have thought about buying their ASUS TUF 17.3\" FHD Gaming Laptop to replace my Acer Predator Computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  BEAUTIFUL LAPTOP. Keyboard lights do have settings but can't pick a specific color which is totally fine with me but just in case people were wondering. What are you waiting for ..","positive":1},{"review":"  The hardware specs are the lowest end of gaming processors in 2020. But this laptop actually delivers better than expected performance out of these components in terms of FPS, temperature, and no major bottlenecks. Its more like a desktop laptop hybrid - a laptop you'd keep plugged in a home. For this reason, I returned this laptop due to fan issues, and I assembled my own desktop PC for half the price and double the framerate.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for Sketchup, Twinmotion, and light gaming.  Overall, it's exactly what I wanted, and about half what I expected I'd have to pay.  Build quality is solid but not spectacular.Overall, if you aren't looking to spend a grand but want a decent 4GB video card, this laptop is an excellent choice.","positive":1},{"review":"  Where to begin. I was not a gamer before buying this Asus tuf laptop. Noise level isn't bad but you can here it when playing games, personally doesn't bother me.  If you are thinking about this laptop just buy it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I never had a laptop that cost this much ($700) .. I initially selected this laptop after another buyer mentioned how you get more for your money. After using ASUS TUF FX505DT for a couple of days, I adore this laptop .","positive":1},{"review":"  Great specs. Added another 8GB RAM.Overall happy with the specs for the price, but it's not perfect. If you're looking for a good budget gaming machine though it'll suit you good.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a solid laptop so far I was not expecting much out of AMD anything, but so far I have been pleasantly surprised. I haven't had a laptop in over a decade and I have been enjoying it immensely. I haven't had any issues that cause the system to crash or freeze up. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to an Intel due to price.","positive":1},{"review":"  the unit is more rigid and military standard tested which i clearly agree . the keys are very good in typing playing etc. The only draw back is the wifi card which constantly drops due to driver issue .  most of the units come with Realtek drivers which is wifi adapter and not good as intel wifi drivers.","positive":0},{"review":"  So this laptop seems amazing so far but for it to really shine it needs a second stick of RAM for that dual channel. However, when i opened up my case to see what I'm rocking for RAM I found, as far as i can tell, that i was STIFFED. The latter is not an option because I'm paying for an online class right now. ASUS support was of no help they just kept regurgitating the specs of the pc back at me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop because I wanted something that I could use to play Deep Rock Galactic, and this seemed to be the cheapest gaming laptop on Amazon.Upon starting it for the first time, I noticed a black line running down the center-left of the screen. After this experience, I'm reluctant to buy another Asus computer in the future. At least I'm able to continue playing Deep Rock Galactic on Nvidia GeForce Now.","positive":0},{"review":"  Really bad product I see there's a lot of inconsistencies with the quality mine just would not work after using it for maybe an hour and a half I updated all the drivers and then my Wi-Fi card would not work so I couldn't use it at all try it if you're not happy with it you can return it like I did but personally I would avoid this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worst Laptop I`ve ever known.

DO NOT BUY.","positive":0},{"review":"  My screen has odd streaks on it, and unfortunately I waited until past the return window for Amazon. ASUS revealed itself as a terrible company. What a mistake and terrible company. I've had much better luck with ACER in the past.","positive":0},{"review":"  Blatantly lies about the strength of the processor (says 3.7Ghz, it`s in reality 2.1, RIDICULOUS) can barely run standard windows (that alone takes 10% of the processor, good luck running any video game) I mean at least it`s a GTX GPU, but unless your game doesn`t require CPU strength, this computer likely isn`t for you.

Not Tuf at all, keyboard broke within 5 months. Toggling bluetooth causes freezing. keyboard flimsy, plastic is so soft and was brushed plastic so it scratches so easily just from handling it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've been a console gamer for a decade and wanted to fiddle with PC gaming again. Couple this with my 8 year old everyday MacBook air showing its age, I figured this laptop would serve as an affordable backup and entertainment device. Just beware of the low storage and expect to spend a bit more on upgrades down the line on RAM and Storage. All in all, a fantastic budget gaming laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer definitely does the job, but I do have the problem of it freezing up, then having to restart it every now and again. Not too often though. It does very well if you are in school and looking for something to type efficiently and also game every now and again, I don`t think I would recommend it to a professional gamer, better to put the money into something that can handle that. But this laptop works well for me in particular.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this for work during the day with a lot going on at once then switch over to gaming at night.Fallout 4 and Overwatch can be played on Ultra settings with no issues. Overwatch + Chrome tabs or video calls with Chrome tabs) and download more than handful of games.Only complaints I have are the camera isn't the greatest (but it does the job) and the speakers don't get super loud, but I'm sure most people getting this will use headsets most of the time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I added a second 8gb ram stick and a terabyte ssd, both were very easy to do. After that i can run the new modern warfare on mostly high settings at 70-80 fps. I did end up buying a 24\" Sceptre monitor because the laptop display has alot of smearing, but display is good enough for when i travel and wanna play a game. Overall if you don't wanna spend $1000+ on your laptop then this is a great choice, if you do then check out Acer predator Helios series.","positive":1},{"review":"  My own laptop is Asus, and I like their brand because their laptops and monitors have always worked well forme.I bought this one for my teen, and I have not heard any FPS-related whining for a while.Great laptop for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  It was $649.99 when I got it.4-Stars for the lack of quality LEDS on the keyboard, max brightness isn't bright at all and some spots have noticeably brighter LEDS which is upsetting.Wi-Fi would drop at least once a day until I had enough and keep it wired at all times now.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is so great. This is one of the best purchases I have made. I got it to just play The Sims 4 on the highest settings with all the expansion packs and it does a great job. I highly recommend this laptop to anybody, even non-gamers.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the first higher end laptop I've ever bought. Usually I like to save money and get one used. The battery is built into the motherboard so replacing wouldn't be easy for most. This laptop takes DDR4 RAM only.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop simply because it was the best value for any laptops with a 120hz monitor. I have only used it for coding and web browsing, and so far there have been no problems with performance (although this laptop should be more than capable for basic tasks). Also, they use a single 8GB SODIMM rather than utilizing dual channel with a 2x4GB set, which in theory gives the ability to add another 8GB down the line, but with the original module only running at max 2666 Mhz, you'd be better off buying faster memory anyways.The memory is the only downside to this laptop so far, everything else has met or exceeded my expectations.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just got this today, and I already love it. I wish it had a longer battery life (1 hr 40 min).","positive":1},{"review":"  the laptop looks like a very good deal for the money but for some reason the software pre installed on the laptop is complete garbage i cant even change the color of the keyboard to plain white im stuck with this rainbow effect and i hate it. on top of that the laptop cannot even play CS:GO at over a 100 fps. i only get around 80 fps on a game that can literally run on anything but this 700 dollar gaming laptop with a 120hz display cannot even output that many frames on the easiest game, ASUS fix your software and dont pre install 20 bloatware programs i will never use in my life .","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall, the laptopis very nice, with a good screen, cool backlight keyboard, and solid construction.  However, it has a major drawback in that the fan constantly runs and is pretty loud.  I added 16GB of memory to it hoping that might help the situation, and it did help somewhat, but the fan still comes on frequently.  I'm not using it in a hot environment, so the fan(s) really shouldn't be coming on this much.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0I asked to replace this laptop, due to several problems on the touchpad. We will see if the replacement has the same problem.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer was great at first, really big and wide.

Fan constantly ran after a few mins of being on. Stopped working after 5 months. We went to get it repaired and they said the motherboard was fried.","positive":0},{"review":"  It sucks up all the battery due to the keyboard. If you leave it un plugged it`s dead by the time you use it again. Some of the buttons don`t work properly.

The track pad just stops working sometimes...","positive":0},{"review":"  So I bought this laptop mainly for school and some gaming during free time, it was doing great the first month but a couple weeks later I'm now having issues connecting to the internet and it keeps saying that the wifi adapter is having issues related to the drivers even though I've been resetting my network every time I diagnose this, it's mainly showing that there is no wifi available and I've tried connecting to my home, school, and others wifi usually ending with the wifi staying on for a few mins then disconnecting. I really have been looking all over for solutions and some work for a short time until it happens again and I'd have to reset the network again. So hopefully someone can help me with this issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this laptop a few days ago and I don`t play a lot of games. The only few games I play were roblox, valorant, and csgo. The package arrived really warm so I was pretty worried then after setting up the laptop I immediately checked the temp and at idle the laptop temps were 40-45 and I thought it was normal at first then I started playing roblox which isn`t a graphic intensive game and temperatures were 70-75 and I knew this wasn`t normal for a gaming laptop and the experience was pretty awful, my screen would freeze while in ac power and the frames would drop a lot if your using battery power for gaming. Overall the experience was pretty awful not recommended, there are cheaper laptops that perform better.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop looks great but keeps crashing \ud83d\ude12.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this on Black Friday for $600, also bought an extra 8 GB ram stick (which was surprisingly easy to install) and an external hard drive for things not worth putting on the limited SSD space.

I also really like the exterior design, doesn`t scream gamer with a bunch of ridiculous aesthetics and is not flimsy at all, hence the name.","positive":1},{"review":"  Probably one of the best sub-$1K laptops I've ever used.

Overall the laptop is great and with a GTX 1650 can run most recently released games, even though she plays a LOT of Stardew ValleyThe main issue she has been having has been staying connected to Wifi.\"Don't want to provide a URL so that this review can be posted but thought I would share with anyone having this issue.

I don't play heavy game just regular one on steam so I never hear the fan the speakers not loud .","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my third ASUS Laptop and after the first two I was VERY, VERY hesitant to buy another.  The first two had power input breakages within a year of purchase, and the henges broke shortly after.The laptop seems very well constructed, 10 10 - with the singular exception of the touchpad that i'd rate an 8 10.  The performance is excellent.","positive":1},{"review":"  TL.DR at bottom.DR: Overall it is a budget laptop with a lot of issues, but I can excuse them because of the price I paid in November 2019. I have no idea if there is something better now.","positive":1},{"review":"  After a couple months of having this laptop I think it`s safe to say that it`s just what I needed.  At first. Easily 60+ framesFortnite ran at 80-110 frames for meFallout 76 ran at a smooth 60-90 framesCSGO easily ran at an amazing 80-124 framesI think you get it. that being said I think you should this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I don't game a lot except for the Sims 4 which on my other laptops slowed them down quite a bit, even on medium graphics setting. This runs the game on the highest setting with ease. No lagging or load times. I wouldn't expect it to handle extreme gaming (though I could be wrong) but I am pretty happy for how it handles so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  The fans are poorly designed. They spin and the oils from the bearings or whatever is in there gets on the fan blades which basically collects a ton of nasty dust over time. Havnt had mine that long and Ive already had to take it apart and clean it to stop the grinding fan noise and overheating issues which did fix it. Other then that i think asus is a great company and i trust them over the rest.","positive":0},{"review":"  Since quarantine and school closures (around march) i hadn't used the laptop much at all. I think today is the first time after 1-2 months that I tried to power on my laptop and it is having power issues.I was able to hear an arc while checking the power adapter so I know that the issue is within the laptop. It could be the battery or it could be something with the MoBo but I don't even see the charging icon on the laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had to return this laptop due to it having ghosting issues on the display. Made it really difficult to play intensive games. I dont know if this was the experience with others.

If I wasn`t outside my return window, it would be back with amazon. Seriously don`t buy this.","positive":0},{"review":"  Save your money, this laptop is terrible and won't last. Freezes constantly, can't go for more than 20 mins without needed to force restart this thing. It only worked smoothly for about a month. I build my own computers and have never had this experience with a computer before.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was great and I finally manage to play a lot of the games I wasn't able to load on my old lap top. After a couple of months it just shuts down on me, took it to repair and they took the lap top a part and found that the hard disk was burnt and done with.I am not sure would I recommend it since now I probably have to buy a new lap top. But it was very smooth when I was using it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The ad for this says a 3.7 GHZ processor, it is 2.. I want to know what I'm buying not what I can configure.","positive":0},{"review":"  The fan is EXTREMELY loud. I'm not a big gamer, I only play Skyrim. The I have it sitting on a desk so ventilation isn't a problem. One of the reasons I bought this one was it boasted about having a quiet fan and this is pretty disappointing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this for my tween. He is new at gaming and wanted a gaming laptop. All in all a great computer for the price. My son is very happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just bought an ASUS fx505dt in august, upgraded from a 6 year old daily driver Dell with zero graphics. So far I've had minimal problems.  I wouldn't recommend it for people with hardcore gaming video editing in mind, but for someone like me who plays older games (No Man's Sky, Witcher 3, Skyrim, etc) and watches movies on their laptop it's good for the price. My one complaint is volume level, the speakers are fairly small and positioned on the sides of the base, so sometimes it's hard to hear (I also have 30% hearing loss from my time in the military, so that's a contributing factor) All in all it's a decent budget rig, but it IS a budget rig.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop is great, especially after adding an extra 8gb of ram and a ssd for more storage. Youre able to play any of todays games without a problem, though youll only achieve 120fps to match the montiors refresh rate on older games (planetside 2, minecraft, roblox, etc. Other than that, its a great laptop and Im glad I bought it. Its a nice buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like the computer so far, I have owned it for about 6 months and am mostly pleased.it ran games like wow, fortnite, diablo 3, and many others with no issues. as a frequent travel I bring my laptop with me everywhere and this one so far has been very durable it has a sturdy feel to the keyboard as well as a precise mouse pad.I would recommend this pc for a mid to high mid gaming or editing.","positive":1},{"review":"  pros : it looks really nice. the keyboard colors look solid and the body on the laptop is solid.I give it a 5 star because it meets my requirements on a laptop. like I said the only minor con is the battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  Tenia tantos a\u00f1os sin renovar mi laptop.

The price was pretty reasonable, but I did have to buy more RAM and another hard drive due to the SSD not having a lot of free space.  Windows 10 starts up fast and so far hasn't had any issues.  I highly recommend getting this laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Is a good computer for the price, don't get me wrong. The GPU is mid grade, and functions great for low budget gamers who want to keep the energy usage low. Also, the description says it came with a Ryzen processor, but this one happened to come with an Intel i5. Also a side note, the computer has 8GB of RAM memory, but you can put up to 16GB, which is nice, I did it myself.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this computer a lot. I bought it because I really like to play Sims games and play with custom content. Sims 1 through sims 4. 10 out of 10 would recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop runs great, when all it's parts work. Unfortunately mine arrived with a dead 256gb Kingston SSD installed so it wasn't working so great immediately. Fortunately I ordered a larger drive at the same time to replace it anyways, so it was only a temporary setback, but still have to lose 1 star for the dead hardware. I will say I love the bios menu, was very easy to read and diagnose that it wasn't registering any storage drive.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a good budget laptop but the problem I have is that the screen is having major issues. My screen started to blinking really bad not blinking white but the colors of the background like it making waves. The packaging was wrapped in tape and the computer was inside a cardboard case so based on other low rated reviews, they probably sent me a refurbished laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I purchased this item, I thought it was a new unit. however, it arrived wrapped in a plastic bag, much like you would expect with a used or refurbished item.  I thought this was new, but that's not what it looks like I got, so I'm giving it one star, especially since the screen included some unexpected fingerprints.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this used from Amazon as the merchant and when i was testing it out the keys wouldn't respond correctly like it would keep refreshing pages on its own and would not let you keep typing. (If its in Microsoft edge) what's worse is it would keep interfering the games i downloaded on steam and would not let me play unless i press every button til its normal for a short time being, be careful when buying products used.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had to return the laptop, it was going to a blue screen after one hour of use then shutting off.","positive":0},{"review":"  Decent laptop for the money but with thermal issues and it's biggest issue is the wifi network card, it's total garbage. Unusable for online gaming or remote desktop usage.","positive":0},{"review":"  The very month I made my final payment, this thing crapped out.  It doesn't even show a \"charging\" light when plugged in.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a lie. The monitor is only 60hz so I'm going to give it a 1 star for that and also I only got not even 2 full hours of gaming before it died. How sad. I will be returning.","positive":0},{"review":"  after having a fight with it to turn on, almost two weeks later a white blotch appears on the screen.

Runs League of Legends great and even runs Final Fantasy 14 great too.5 SDD (I recommend getting additional storage for the 256GB as that is not a lot of space if you wish to install more games.) which makes it nice that it has upgrade options.","positive":1},{"review":"  Exceeded my expectations as a Blizzard player (WoW, Diablo, Hearthstone). Runs them all great with very high FPS even with other apps running. Does everything else you would normally do great as well. Have not tried any industrial software but I'm thinking it would do it no sweat.","positive":1},{"review":"  Amazing mid priced gaming laptop. Only thing I'm frustrated about is barely over a month in and the fans already making a vibrating sound. Best performance is while it's plugged in by far. Battery doesn't last long unplugged  but going great for graphics and speed for those games.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my sister-in-law at Christmas time. She is a commercial artist and was desperately in need of a new laptop that way she could work at home while she was pregnant. Very durable. Excellent computers.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works perfect was hoping for 70 fps while playing apex and this thing by far exceeded those expectations.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is a steal. The new GTX 1650 is plenty of horsepower for mild to heavy 1080p gaming (depending on the title). Other than the battery and the touch pad issue this thing would be a 5 5 stars. (side note yes the storage and RAM sizes are on the low side but if you have the courage to upgrade it yourself this laptop really has a lot of potential).","positive":1},{"review":"  Out of the box this thing was okay. After adding another 8GB stick of RAM and a 1tb SSD it screams pretty good now. The screen is absolutely beautiful and so is the keyboard but within a couple weeks I'm owning it the LEDs for the spacebar no longer light up, not a huge deal as I'm not that into RGB and have kept it off lately but still something that's rated for 2 million keystrokes I figured the lights would last a bit longer. Performance-wise I get a good 58 FPS on high settings with Shadow of the Tomb Raider.","positive":1},{"review":"  this is a gaming school-work laptop for my kid.  all it needed was another dimm and a data drive.the fans can get loud under forza, however the performance stays consistent and frame rates are excellent.  in 2016 doom 1080p at high settings this thing purs at well over 100fps, and on the 120hz display it's a joy to behold.","positive":1},{"review":"  Two weeks in and zero problems, fantastic performance in every game. If you plan on buying this for gaming though you need to upgrade ram and set all power save settings to maximize performance. Good god, be prepared to have no mouse if you dont use an external one. That being said this is still a very solid all around machine and a great purchase, lots of value here.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this gaming laptop for my 13 year olds gaming and for a couple businesses online. The key board is absolutely exactly what is described. It was a great buy for the money. This is a honest review.","positive":1},{"review":"  The amount of bloatware ASUS has placed on this laptop is ridiculous. Anyone who decides to purchase this laptop should wipe it and install a fresh copy of Windows before doing anything else. Who knows how much of your personal info ASUS is siphoning up with all the extra telemetry crap that comes preinstalled on this laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`ve had mine for three days and it already froze up trying to play music on YouTube. Ctrl-alt-Del wouldn`t do a thing. Also, this thing can barely pick up my WIFI, and drops it all the time, every 30 sector so. None of my other devices have that issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had my computer about two weeks now. The battery lasts about 4-5 hours, the mouse track pad intermittently cuts out so it's difficult to use, and the two times I have attempted to play a game, the computer has crashed. I wasn't expecting the world's best computer, but I was kind of expecting something that actually worked consistently and reliably for the price tag.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just after a few months in, the laptop has completely died with the only sign of life being the keyboard that lights up when I plug it in to charge. No screen, no fans running, absolutely nothing beyond the keyboard.","positive":0},{"review":"  After the first  month of use the fan noise  got really  bad. Loud rattling noise even  in silent mode. It runs most games in medium  settings  smoothly.  The battery  life  is not great but enough to get the job done.","positive":0},{"review":"  First, box was damaged, the laptop works fine at first, not glitchy and does what it supposed to do. However after few usage, now I can hear some crackling snapping sound when opening and closing the laptop, I just hope it would survive long enough to satisfy the costs payed.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered version with monitor of 120 hz and I got FX505DT-UB52 It is no the same like description, I should get FX505DT-AH51 (120hz monitor).","positive":0},{"review":"  It's crashes alot freeze up and stutter. Playing the games sucks am better off on my 970.","positive":0},{"review":"  i ordered this laptop cause in description they said 120 hz refresh rate screen but they lied its only 60hz , but overall is good laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  My unit arrived looking in new condition but after updating the drivers everything was horrendously laggy and choppy.  I'm willing to bet it was a one off but figure I would leave the review in case its not.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop cost is cheap compare to other laptops and thermals are actually better in these kind of laptops having GTX 1660 gives you better thermals than using RTX in slim gaming laptops.You can buy a HDD. and 8gb Ram and this laptop is a sick gaming machine for about 730$RTX works for new 2020 expensive laptops.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a bangin little laptop. Plays world of warcraft like a dream. Does not run hot while gaming. If you're on the fence, hop off and buy this lil gem.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very good computer with great expandability. Runs online games very well and is more than enough for casual teenagers who game after homework.. You can't beat the price for the capability you get.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop so far has delivered the important parts of a laptop i was looking for. 120ghz screen, decent graphic card for the games I want play, ssd for operating system and fast boot. Overall a very nice laptop for the price. Very happy with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  better than the nitro 5 it has a 120hz ips panel very color accurate with cool temps never raised over 65 degrees celcius while gaming would reccomend one issue i had was it locking at 30 fps on battery but low and behold it was just a setting in geforce experience called battery boost dont hesitate this is the best laptop ive ever owned.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything works wonderfully, the only drawback is that the wireless adapter installed with the laptop didn't work. This could just be a specific case scenario and that i just got a faulty hardware in 1 in a 100000 chance, but it is what it is. Again this could be a very low chance and that i got unlucky but something to keep in mind. Thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  This machine is pretty sweet for the price, it can play almost every game at 60fps (albeit with settings tweaked) its not exactly the strongest machine by any means, but it gets the job done for most tasks. At the price of 700 this laptop is worth getting for low-mid range gaming. The one suggestion is to smack a extra 8gb of ram into it immediately.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I absolutely LOVE this laptop. While I'm sure it's not the greatest gaming laptop you can get, it does however play a lot of games really smoothly. I've played Skyrim on it's Ultra graphics with only a slight lag spike here and there (turning Skyrim to it's second highest graphic setting will completely solve that issue), the remake for Resident Evil 2, Subnautica, Amnesia: The Dark Descent and many other games. If you want a good gaming laptop without wanting to shell out $1000+ then this is a great laptop to get.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great introductory gaming laptop. I bought this specifically to play one game, so my needs weren't anything extreme. I haven't used it for any other game though, so I haven't tested it's real capabilities yet.The RBG keyboard is decent, but like other reviewers state, it's pretty dim even on it's brightest setting.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very pleased with my purchase, this laptop is well put together, not so heavy that it cannot be moved around easily. Easy to upgrade with extra RAM and or an extra SSD or HDD, opening it can be done in a couple of minutes with a simple screwdriver. Battery wise I cannot say yet, but if travelling on an airplane it would imo definitely require extra juice from a powerbank. This laptop is a must have for the occasional gamer who wishes to replace their current laptop and or tower PC.","positive":1},{"review":"  Screen and speaker port having issues already and hard to get in touch with manufacturer or use their website for service   warranty. Nice laptop though runs game smoothly .","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop is pretty good for gaming though I mostly use it for school work, I've had it for around 3 months but some of the pixels are starting to go faint on the side of the screen which is annoying. Good otherwise though for battery life.","positive":0},{"review":"  the battery charge doesn't last.","positive":0},{"review":"  touchpad is jittery and unresponsive, no matter how many drivers you update. It will freeze and not respond for 2-3 seconds and then work again just to be unresponsive again.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer crashes at least once every day with a fatal blue screen of death and we have only had it about a month.  When it works, it works fine, but the crashes make it completely unreliable.  It will be returned.","positive":0},{"review":"  It runs most games fairly well but by far the worst battery I've ever had on a laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop so I can play maplestory with my friends owoI don't know why but it keeps crashing especially when I screen record.I have updates drivers and still have the issue.If anyone know why this is happening, please let me know.","positive":0},{"review":"  Garbage , keeps crashing. 2 days after return window crashed x3.","positive":0},{"review":"  My son ordered this gaming laptop he didn`t like it so we sent it back.

I was also looking for a decent machine to avoid adulting with. I'd definitely recommend this guy to anyone looking for a machine that operates well above average in every regard. Nice work Asus.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this computer to replace my 10 year old Alienware.  So far after 3 weeks I love it.  I totally recommend if you are a casual gamer and also need a budget friendly laptop.  Also it did come with a 256GB hard drive but there is a port for another internal hard drive.","positive":1},{"review":"  Best laptop for its price and extremely upgradeable.  Works great for gaming and everything else.  However it worked great before that, I already had the parts so just added them which made it a super computer.  You can do the same for fairly cheap.","positive":1},{"review":"  Out of the systems that were within this price range, this one is literally the best you can get for this year. Anyone interested in getting a system for gaming current AAA titles, this is the one to get for mobile on the go gaming.","positive":1},{"review":"  My expectations weren't too high about this but this laptop is fire.It just needs some tweakings, update this update that and you are good to go.The gameplay so far is pretty good even with 8gb Only, I have another spare and I can't imagine the potential of this laptop with 16gb RAM.I have honestly no cons whatsoever, it is a great deal and I recommend it to everyone, good for gaming and Programming editing.","positive":1},{"review":"  En general es  un buen equipo.Compr\u00e9 el equipo con 8Gb de RAM CON  SSD DE 240 GB.Como punto negativo en este caso son  los ventiladores que suenan mucho al usar la potencia de video para los juegos 3D.En cuanto a la bater\u00eda, esperaba un poco m\u00e1s para las actuales bater\u00edas tomando en cuenta que el equipo fue concebido para juegos, ya que all usarlo para actividades diarias y sin usar juegos, dura 2,5 horas.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer performance wise is very good for the price.  I am able to play Apex legends and Minecraft with little issue with the the fps. I wouldn't recommend it for multi use as a business computer if you travel a lot. But, if you are looking to have a reliable gaming computer that you can bring to your friend's house that doesn't weigh 20 lbs I would recommend this computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall great laptop, boots fast, graphics are great and RGB keyboard looks great.  I'll be adding another 8G or ram but Ive been playing CSGO, Modern Warfare, PUBG with out any issues..  I got this on Black Friday for $599 and very happy with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Asus comes minus a few apps you NEED like the one that controls the LED keyboard controller. I have an amplified system I put the sound through, the quality was not good. However, Realtek equalizer saved the day. I don't use headphones.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this as a gift for my sister.She really loves how light yet durable it is. So far no slow downs or issues what so ever, but that's what you should expect with ASUS, a great and reliable brand.Very fast and reliable.","positive":1},{"review":"  It arrived faulty. Slowly over the next few months it ran slower and slower. I highly do NOT recommend this for a gaming laptop. Barely functions when watching a video online.","positive":0},{"review":"  Don't get me wrong, this laptop is good, but the battery life is awful. And the storage.

The battery is about 4 hours while gaming. IO is what you would expect on a 700 dollar laptop.It is a very light and thin laptop great for mobility.","positive":1},{"review":"  Yes. The battery life sucks at only 5 hours. Its internal memory is pitiful, but investing in a $90 SSHD or hybrid drive fixes this issue as long as you're willing to spend the money. The refresh rate is butter smooth and along with the powerful graphics card, triple A titles run beautifully and nearly effortlessly.","positive":1},{"review":"  4 5 all around. I wish the trackpad was a lot better but that's true of most windows laptop pads. The tough bump rating is useful as I travel with it a lot. I'd recommend this laptop to most people.","positive":1},{"review":"  Amazing Laptop. I've always wanted a gaming PC but had a difficult time justifying thousands (to the wife) So this was an amazing compromise. When you order this please do yourself a favor and get at least 16GB of RAM and 2TB SSD drive the TUF mouse. It'll put you over 1k USD but it's worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  bought this for my daughter for getting good grades. the RGB backlit keyboard is a cool feature though not as tactile as \"I\" would like but she loves it...","positive":1},{"review":"  Great laptop, going good so far.

It was the lowest priced item that was both brand new and capable for what I wanted. All together I am very satisfied.

I know you get what you pay for but given this laptop was only a few pound less than the HP entry level alternative I thought it must have some redeeming features.

PC World can't attempt to fix it - they say they can't do Fusion 5. I had a fairly recent back up of data, so life goes on ok, but I wish it had been a more recent back up.

Have always liked Dell, like it, even more, when purchased throughAmazon, with their 90-day warranty plan, and extended coverage available.Highly recommend buying factory re-furbished computer or other similar devices through Amazon as opposed to eBay, or other competitors.","positive":1},{"review":"  Runs well, is quick to start and turn off, in good shape.  Glad I purchased this.  It took me a few days to figure out how to remove it .  I like this PC and would recommend it if on a budget and need a business pc that is lightweight and very functional.","positive":1},{"review":"  This had the specs I wanted in a cheap laptop: 256GB SSD, 8GB memory, and Windows 10 Pro.  It came in a box with some industrial-strength bubble wrap.  After it was enabled I had no problem setting up BitLocker.  Now I have a great little PC for MS Office applications and online work for a great price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This unit is replacing an obsolete laptop I have had for about 7 years, the I5 processor is not the fastest but it does what I needed it to do. It came with a 250 GB SSD and 8 GB of memory, it takes only a few seconds to boot Windows 10, which came pre-installed. It is easy to upgrade the memory and the hard drive, only 6 screws and the bottom cover comes off giving you access to both. One thing to note is that this laptop has an integrated display driver, it uses part of the RAM for the graphics, if you need a fast graphics processor, this is not the laptop for you, if your work does not involve graphics processing, then I highly recommend this unit.","positive":1},{"review":"  Decided to retire.  I needed to replace my work laptop a Dell Latitude E5450 14in with the latest version of Windows 10 Pro.  Very happy with my new laptop. Thanks Primetime Buys.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Dell laptop (Latitude E7270)  is a workhorse that I have used in the past so I decided to go with the same brand again. I`m a writer, and always on the go however the durability of this Dell laptop takes a beating and doesn`t falter.

When restarting I write the F2 and notified by the same computer since the 2018 and gave problems, not if the battery was changed or if it was believed to be in good condition, what happens is that I bought a product that said as new and I have to think about investing a new battery , it's not fair and I feel a bit mocked.","positive":0},{"review":"  The physical product condition is OK however when i booted it for first time windows crashed.I have to enter windows recovery and reset every thing which tooke for me like 4 hours to get it running.

For the price, it`s just about as much as you could ask for.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a basic, affordable laptop for mild office school use.

Decent (not stellar) performance out of a quad core processor.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the size and price of this model, this computer is excellent. The battery life is better than larger laptops, and the keyboard is comfortable to type on unlike the netbooks of the past.

It`s a little touchy when using finger gestures. Other than that, great computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am not computer literate, so please excuse my neolithic descriptions.

In researching pads as a replacement, I automatically discarded the higher priced ones with adjustable speeds, glowing LEDs, trendy designs, and whatnots considering my laptop would be covering all that expensive eye candy.

As for price, it`s a great value for the quality & thinness.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very surprised at the effectiveness of this.Using this on a 2018 13\" i7 MacBook Pro. Some very unofficial and basic tests to show how it helps on an '18 13\" MPB.

Overall, I am very impressed with both.  After testing, I prefer the havit because it is quieter and it drops the temperature of my laptop by 10 degrees so the fan doesn't go into the high-speed mode unless I am doing something to require high CPU or GPU utilization.Picture 1 - without cooler on a flat deskPicture 2 - Havit - model F2056Picture 3 - Tree New Bee - model K0025Tests performed on a 15.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this cooling pad every day with my MSI GS65 gaming laptop.  It's powered over USB and has 3 giant fans which keep the laptop as cool as possible while gaming.Overall I'd recommend this cooling pad to anyone looking for a budget-friendly option.  It's not the best out there, but it does its job and I can't complain.","positive":1},{"review":"  I play Sims 4 on my laptop, and always use this while playing. I can tell a noticeable difference when I play without using this fan, versus when I play while using it. I can't hear it running unless it's deadly silent in the room, and even then it is not all that loud at all. I watch TV sometimes while I game, and you can't hear it whatsoever when I do.","positive":1},{"review":"  does a great job of cooling my older hp that has a bad fan in it, it no longer gets hot. This is a very quiet product, cannot hear it unless in extremely quiet setting, and then just fan sound. Love that this has a tilt feature, actually like using my laptop with this more than before. It does raise your laptop about an 1\" minimum, but with the tilt feature it is very comfortable to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  The LEDs are quite bright on this. I use this to cool my laptop when DJing hot events.I would recommend this product, but I also want to see how long these fans last. The LEDs are being removed as I speak so hopefully it doesn't distract people when I am using it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a 15\" laptop that sometimes gets quite toasty, especially when sitting on cloth, and decided it was time to look for a cooler.  I grabbed one of these plates after seeing all of the positive reviews on it.  The only downside of this cooler is that you can't turn the LEDs off, so you will have some blue (da-ba dee da-ba) walls at night.  Despite that, it does what it says on the tin, and I give it a 5 5.","positive":1},{"review":"  Five stars. Five MILLION stars.. I'm buying more.","positive":1},{"review":"  PROs:* Cools nicely* Fans are quiet* Extra USB slot (ABSOLUTE NECESSITY)* Looks pretty cool* Can shut off the fans lights with a switch when you don't need cooling or to save power.CONs:* NO ANTI-SKID (the picture pointing to anti-skid bar is BS)* Fans & lights are only controlled by the switch.Considering it has competitors with the same benefits (size, decent cooling, quiet, extra usb port) but that offer anti-skid mechanisms that work for the same or lower price.I'll be sending this back.","positive":0},{"review":"  It looks nice, but performs horribly. Fans spin extremely slow and there's not nearly enough air being pulled to cool my laptop. I will leave my temperature tests below. I also reapplied thermal paste to my CPU about a few weeks ago also, using Arctic Silver 5.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't like to leave a negative review, but the fans quit on this.  The first fan stopped working just outside the 30 day return period.  It's a shame the product is not built more solidly.  I may buy another laptop cooler, but it will have to be a more robust and dependable product.","positive":0},{"review":"  When i plug the usb cable into my computer, the fans don't run. i plugged it into a usb plug charger. When you press the power button, it keeps turning off. Doesn't stay on long enough.","positive":0},{"review":"  So many things wrong with this. It has 7 LEDs which are all on all the time. That`s your only job. Frustrating.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have a Macbook pro and this cooling pad was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. First off it doesnt cool the laptop as my ordinary fan does, the laptop still gets hot even in night when temperatures are alot cooler. The kickstand is a horrible feature to this as well, because the computer easily slides off the mesh due to no rubber gripping on the top part of the cooling pad. My conclusion is, its better you spend your money on something more expensive as this product is far too overrated.","positive":0},{"review":"  Hi, I bought this product almost 11 months back and was very happy with the performance UNTIL NOW...EPIC FAIL.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought 2 and both are dead already.  Not even 6 months so will try another brand for sure.","positive":0},{"review":"  Cheap, worked for a couple months before becoming unresponsive.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product has lovely blue lights that are on when it's receiving power, which is a good thing since I wouldn't know by the fans themselves that they were on.  I don't feel any air at all moving from either side of this cooling pad - which also accounts for it's silent running.  My laptop has shown no difference in the heat it gives off and I'd even be willing to hear some noise if it meant there was actual air flow cooling my laptop.  Need to find a better cooling pad.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have had this now for a few weeks working virtually day night non-stop. It keeps two external hard drives attached to my iMac desktop computer cool and it is very quiet. Furthermore, much has been written about blue wavelength light shifting sleep cycles (I am practice sleep medicine and neurology) and having the ability to turn it red instead of blue (~ 440 nm) (or any other wavelength instead of blue, for that matter, would be helpful when working at night in the evening.I have no hesitation at all, at this time, recommending this unit, overall.","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn't like the bright blue lights, so I ripped them out with pliers. It's really easy to unscrew the two pieces, and if you just yank the bulbs out or twist them until the wire breaks, the fans still work fine.This does a better job at keeping my laptop cool than I thought it would. I keep it plugged in to my laptop at all times and it doesn't seem to have too much of an effect on the battery.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been using Belkin laptop cooling platforms for years. The first one lasted many years, then started sounding like a helicopter so I bought another. Belkin cooling platforms and ruggedness don't belong in the same sentence. I just hooked it up and can't address durability but my initial impressions are very, very good.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am on my computer a Lot.  I play an Android game, and to do that, I must use an Emulator.  I believe that this will extend the life of my expensive laptop.  Bravo.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop cooling pad does exactly what it is designed to do. It helps keep my new laptop cool while I am running intensive applications or games. As long as it keeps working fine like this I will never have a complaint.Dimensions are confirmed as advertised.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can keep this short.  The product is exactly as explained.  Very sturdy with aluminum top and strong, good feet.  A very good purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've gone through many laptop fans throughout the years. Oftentimes, they couldn't keep my laptop cool enough.I've gotten some cooling laptop fans for cheap before, but this product is one that I'm glad I put more money towards. It's one of those times when its worth to pay a little extra to get a higher quality item.","positive":1},{"review":"  Would like to give this more than 5*.  I use a laptop for a home theater application that stays on 24 7, on charger, lid closed, max performance 0 power saving settings.  I suppose if I cared enough about that I could do some tinkering and fix that, but doesn't bother me enough to do so.  After several months of being on constantly all the fans still work, they're are still silent, and it still moves lots of air.","positive":1},{"review":"  This brand is excellent. I'm a believer in Laptop coolers to extend the life of the PC.I can't think of any other brand I would consider at any price. More than 2 years, and all three are still running great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have to say that I am actually really impressed with this cooling pad.  I bought it on Amazon Prime Day and just received it yesterday.  It has a solid metal casing that I hope will be more durable than the plastic cooling pads that I have bought in the past.  To me, this is worth the money you pay for it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Product arrived as promised, well packed and in great condition.  This product worked perfectly for 8 months and did exactly what it was designed to do.  Now it just makes noise constantly, like a bad fan bearing.  My rating is based on my belief that this product should have performed for far more than 8 months.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've picked this up as a replacement for my previous cooling pad, which has gotten too loud, plus it is very uncomfortable if i need to put it on my lap.This one has a form that appears to be able to pull air even if its on my lap.Fix those two thing and this could be a 5 star cooling pad (still testing but the cooling appears to be in the \"pretty good\" area.) But combined those make this something I will probably return.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have a gaming laptop (Acer Aspite V Nitro) with GTX 960M i7 processors. The form factor and cooling system are really bad for the temps I get while gaming (93-95C playing Overwatch on high). I bet it'd make more of a difference with less demanding games though.I'll update this review if I think of anything else or if anything changes.","positive":0},{"review":"  My kingdom for a decent cooling pad.. The airflow is decent and it serves it purpose on your lap or table until it fails due to the cons above.Why on earth nobody can make a solid constructed pad with good airflow which can be maintained is beyond me, but I've now gone through several of the top rated pads on Amazon and they all either have these exact design flaw, do not allow maintenance, or have horrible airflow.","positive":0},{"review":"  I probably should have looked around more.  Like many reviews have pointed out the fans are arranged wrong.  I bent them up a bit and \"painted\" the three sides black with a sharpie magic marker and then pushed them back down and painted the top edge.  Now I can barely see the blue light when the laptop is on the pad.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really excited for this, but it did not meet my expectations. I do like the slanted surface and the elevated design, which alleviates wrist pain while typing, but the inability to turn off the \"cool\" blue lights on the bottom is kind of annoying. A small inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.The fans do a fine job with cooling I guess, and the extra USB in the back is a nice touch, but I am ultimately disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  For videos related to the lack of strength in the air flow, you can check other comments (there are very good videos showing that particular issue).I'm trying to focus on the following question 2 questions:- Does this board actually makes any difference in terms of temperature.The design and everything else is just perfect (so far, I've not used this long enough to know if it will die with some months of use). But it just didn't work for me, and I'm not sure it will perform any better for anyone that will be putting some load on his her laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought Havit HV-F2056 15.6\"-17\" Laptop Cooler Cooling Pad to cool an Thinkpad X1 Extreme Lenovo (2018).Overall, I would not recommend this product if you intend to use your laptop under heavy load. Since my workload is not that heavy and I just needed the elevation slight cooling I am keeping the product as the return process is just too tedious.","positive":0},{"review":"  This fan cooling pad is terrible for providing support. Air is pushed out the bottom, not out the top. Other that that, the fans are pretty quiet and the accent blue light is cool. If you have a large laptop or have vents on the bottom don`t buy this.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to give this 5 stars because it does keep my laptop cool, but there were other factors that came into play. Maybe I received one that snuck past quality assurance. The minor errors I found can be fixed with some ingenuity. However, I am a little concerned about the USB ports since they power the pad.","positive":0},{"review":"  One has to assume that laptop manufacturers design their products for adequate cooling.  That said, we all know that heat kills products, especially electronics.  It's like having a fire extinguisher - if you don't use it, will it work when needed.  So, I'm happy with this product and hope it adds life to my laptop's life.","positive":1},{"review":"  Alright\u201a so I'm an owner of an HP Pavilion dv6 (if anyone is wondering). Previously\u201a I've been having a lot of problems with my laptop via heat.No further cons on it.Works well\u201a just be careful with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  For many months I had issues with my laptop overheating to the extent I would switch it off just to let it cool down before I could use it again. I tried googling for some solutions to minimize the overheating and I came across the idea of buying a cooling pad. It is amazing how this product works so well with such silent fans. I cannot recommend this product enough.","positive":1},{"review":"  Within the past year I noticed that my 5 year old 15 inch Dell XPS laptop was producing an excessive amount of heat, especially after I needed to install a new motherboard.  The diagnostic and utility software that I used to monitor and clean up my laptop kept telling me that the CPU and graphics card temperature kept rising to over 200 degrees Fahrenheit and the internal cooling fans kept turning on never seemed to go off.  Finally, it's so quiet and the blue LED lights make it look very cool.I'm very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the HAVIT HV-F2056 to anyone who is looking for a high quality, rightly priced cooling pad.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Laptop Cooler has fixed my heating problems on my 17 inch HP laptop. I do a lot of video work and my laptop gets hot. I don't know how it could be any better. I would buy it again and highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wasn't honestly expecting much by way of a cooling pad, having had bad experiences in the past. In the past, I would either find that they would die quickly or not have a high enough cooling effect, to where it didn't matter if I had one or not. Despite this though, it is easily the best cooling pad I've ever bought and just bought another for my mother. Definitely recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  This works perfectly. I bought this myself, for myself, and with my own money. I use it for my 13.3 in Mac book but it can be used for a 17 in laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works just as stated. Not too loud or noisy for it to be annoying or anything. Also a note that if you're laptop is shut off and not plugged in to charge and this cooler is still plugged in and on, it will continue to work because it will just drain whatever your laptop battery has left so I recommend turning it off right when you shut down your laptop or else you will forget. ): Overall great product and will purchase again if something happens to this one.","positive":1},{"review":"  This cooling base is just what I needed. I wasn't happy with the bulky riser tray and portable USB fan setup I was using before in order to keep my heavy, bulky Acer Predator laptop from overheating. Total win all around. I'm a very happy camper.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great price, surprisingly good product.  I always find it odd to see an item get 20 5-stars and then 20 1-stars.  Would certainly recommend to others, I think you'll be well pleased.  Wish I had bought this years ago.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wish I got one that you could change the RPMs of and that wasn't a glowing blue (no you can't turn it off unless you turn off the fan). I also wish I could move the fans to better suit my laptop fan distribution. And elevates the comp which is okay I guess.Would love recommendations for a different one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was having issues with my 17\" gaming laptop thermal throttling. I even undervolted the CPU to try and remedy the situation, with moderate success.

I know the bigger laptops do get hot.  When this first occured, I tried emailing the sellers via email and never received anything back from there.  I am coming online today to try to find one that will last longer than a couple months.","positive":0},{"review":"  I used this for my gaming laptop for about a year. The fans did work at keeping my laptop cool, I could physically feel the difference touching my laptop so that was great. Hate them. I am not an angsty teenager.","positive":0},{"review":"  All these glowing reviews and here i sit disappointed,  I have had this for a few months now and  find it to be more hassle then it is worth.  first big complaint why did they put the usb connection on the back of it seriously why did they not put the  usb and controls on the side of it it is a pain,  you have to perform a reach around just to turn it on. where there are no vents, you can turn it around and put the 2 fans towards the back and it works better but then you can't use the legs and you have a usb cord sticking out the front of the laptop to get snagged on all the time.  and my last complaint my laptop slides around on it it's not horrible but it is enough to get annoying and the fans vibrates it does not make any noise it's just a vibration you can feel in the keyboard .","positive":0},{"review":"  The unit itself seems well made but it has one huge flaw-the 3 fans are configured wrong for my HP laptop. The fans are arranged with two fans in front and one in the rear, with the fans grouped in the center of the unit.  The only positive I found about using the unit \"upside down\" is the power switch is now in the front.  Definitely would not recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this cooling pad for my ASUS Rog Strix, and the first negative I noticed was the placement of the fans. If the two fans were placed in the back instead the front, it would have been fine for my machine, but I wasn't getting the full advantage of the fans because of their placement. For a gaming laptop, temperature is everything. I realize that this pad may work for others, but it just wasn't a good fit for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm not sure why this product got such high ratings, but I also never owned a cooling pad before so I have nothing to compare to. This seems very useful for laptops that exhausts heat from the bottom side, but for ones that have the heatsink on the sides, this doesn't seem to do that much even though it dropped a couple degrees. The pull isn't that strong either, but it is fairly quiet, so you sacrifice one for the other. My other gripe about this is the rubber feet towards the front are terrible, they've already started falling off and don't have a lot of grip (on glass anyway).","positive":0},{"review":"  Note: in my original review of this product, I gave it a full 5 stars. But some flaws have appeared in the month that I've been using it. It's kind of thick.I'll update this as time goes on because I don't know about the reliability of this unit yet.","positive":0},{"review":"  The HAVIT HV-F2056 works well with my ASUS fx502vm laptop. Not only do the fans run quietly and efficiently but the additional elevation provided allows even more airflow than without the HAVIT HV-F2056 cooling pad. This will pair nicely with my current laptop and so far, i am incredibly satisfied with the device. When my friends or family need cooling solutions for their laptops, i will recommend HAVIT.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ordered this because I play a game on my laptop that caused it to get really hot and then the laptop would start to stutter. It does not lower the temp much but what it does it causes the airflow underneath the laptop just enough so that the overheating problem is not as bad. I wish there was a way to disable them and keep the fans on. I thought about opening it up and seeing if I could disconnect the wires going to the lights but then I don't want to take a chance of messing the entire thing up and having to buy another one.","positive":1},{"review":"This is a wonderful product.  It keeps my HP Laptop cool, is silent, and the blue light is not distracting at all.  I have birds, and I'm always amazed at the amount of bird dander I find on the bottom and sides of my laptop and the bottom of the fans - but that is not a fault of the fan, its preventing it from getting into the bottom of my laptop - thus extending the life of it.  Another great benefit of this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop cooling fan was great gift for my kid, he really loved the glowing blue.  The fans are really quiet and the adjustable height helps lift if off the surface.  The On Off toggle is nice giving an option to turn off the blue light fan while still plugged in.  When the device is turned off the pass through USB port still functions.","positive":1},{"review":"  Until two years ago, I'd never owned a laptop ( I own a notebook) and so never had a need for a cooler.  It wasn't until I installed The Sims 3, my all-time favorite game,  that I discovered certain modes of the game were unplayable because of overheating issues.  Best of all, I can play my favorite game for hours at a time.All in all, an excellent  product.","positive":1},{"review":"  It works good, the only complaint I would have is that the air doesn't blow up on the side of my laptop, where the heat is coming from.  In order for it to work, I rotate the fan around so the on switch is on the bottom, and placing the laptop over the top left fan, so it gets the air, which seems to be working.  Attached pictures show how the top left fan (blue) is placed to where it hits the area where the heat is coming out of, which with normal placement, it would continue to overheat.  It also no longer smells now that it keeps that section cool.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a neat device. However, I notice that the fans don't actually help out my laptop much. Also, I wouldn't use it on a laptop that might have fans blowing downward--these fans would then fight those fans. Overall, this pad is structurally pretty strong and very light and the fans are very quiet.","positive":1},{"review":"  I rely heavily on reliable Laptop Cooling Pads in order to keep my laptop working without overheating.  As a blogger and website designer I work sometimes 20 hr.  Should the performance change, will change my review accordingly. Highly Recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for the sole purpose of cooling my Razer Blade laptop while gaming.  Before I used this product, the laptop's CPU usually runs around 90 degree Celsius and the case (on the underside) gets very warm to the touch.  The price from Amazon is the lowest that I was able to find.  I am very satisfied and will definitely buy product again when needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this cooling pad for one of my PCs in May 2017.  I loved it so much that I purchased a second one in November 2017 for my other PC.  AMAZING customer service.  Thank you, Havit.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a beautiful laptop stand, I wish I could write a better review. But, after just 3 months of very basic usage, one of the fans is going bad, and there's an obnoxious noise now that has me unplugging it. It sits here, not moving, not being touched, jostled, or beat up.And yet, I now have to replace it because I can't handle the noise.","positive":0},{"review":"  A lot of people complain about the blue LED lights. I didn't like them either, so I decided to do something about it. When I'm doing work that requires a lot of processing, my internal laptop fan still runs like crazy. On the upside, this cooler is very comfortable to use on your lap, giving a nice buffer zone that keeps your legs from getting too hot.","positive":0},{"review":"  Well. definitely meant to be on a desk. yet it might be worth the expense to experience a little tickle down there. You will have to experience that for yourself to determine.","positive":0},{"review":"  The fans spin, but there is no airflow.  This pad simply does nothing at all.  I thought maybe my unit is defective, but if so, why does it light up and the fans spin.  I do not recommend this pad at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this because of the great reviews but after almost an year of using this just to give it a good try, I realize how USELESS and weak this fan is.

It weighs only a pound an a half but you can tell why, the plastic seems very flimsy, almost like if it dropped on its side of fell from off the counter it would crack and break.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is basically worthless as a cooling fan for any electronics. The fans are turning but even with my hand directly on top of it, I can hardly feel any air. So, it's a paperweight. The blue led's are pretty so there's that I suppose.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don`t know how anyone could give this worthless fan a positive review.  If you trust one review, make it this one.  Seriously, my 5 lb chihuahua passes more wind when he has gas than this crummy fan does.  Don`t waste your money on this defective worthless product.","positive":0},{"review":"  PROS:-affordable-does affect temperature somewhat-cool blue light-noise level is acceptable. it's obviously there, but it's not overbearing and pretty easy to tune out.CONS:-cool blue light-cheap materials: plastic bottom flexes and rubs on fan blades when I pick up the laptop and the cooler at the same time-the passive effect of unfolding the legs drops temps more (-6F) than using the fans (-4F)-power switch is tiny and hard to reach-THE WORST thing about this unit though: there is NO LIP to keep your laptop from sliding around when the legs are propped up, just some very shallow grooves that I guess every laptop ever made's feet should fit.SUMMARY: I think this thing is still useful on top of blankets and carpets, but unless you have a machine prone to overheating and or push your gear to max load regularly, a passive cooler would probably do the job for most people.","positive":0},{"review":"  This would probably work really well , or if u use your computer on the floor, next to the outlet---Hooray. I'm so very tired of getting the wrong item  or a poorly conceived item from Amazon--this does not reach tony desk orbed or chair---the cord which must stay plugged when using, is too short to box with my computer,( leaving God out of it), so I have to search for or buy an additional item to have this one work for me. I do not want to spend my life sending things back  to  Amazon  or purchasing more items to make the first item work. Never again.","positive":0},{"review":"  My old laptop cooling pad was in pretty bad shape, so I got this one as a replacement. Very nice.I paid full price for this product. My review is honest and even after having it for almost 6 months, it's still just as quiet as it ever was.","positive":1},{"review":"  My 6 years old Macbook Pro started to overheat after the Catalina OS upgrade, and the internal fans would operate like crazy with several apps, Zoom for example.I have been using this cooling pad for over a month now, and it does what it's supposed to do for the most part. and (3) the incline isn't adjustable.Overall, decent product that does what it's supposed to do.","positive":1},{"review":"  Features:There is a switch.LEDs (though not switchable).

My last minor complaint is that there is one power switch for both the fans and the lights.","positive":1},{"review":"  This item arrived on time and works as advertised. I have been using it for a couple days and am pleased so far. I would either just make this cooling pad with four fans to universally cover any laptop's vent position or I would flip the arrangement and have two fans in the upper portion and one in the lower portion.Overall, this is proving to be a worthwhile investment provided it holds up.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a gaming laptop that I use on a kitchen table.  But it would get really hot while running games especially if I had the charger connected.  The biggest winner here is really the design, I think, due to the improved airflow.Overall, if you need to improve cooling on your laptop, this stand has my full recommendation.","positive":1},{"review":"  Keeps laptop cool.  Lots of air flow and has a nice coating on the grille.  It sat on the desk while the laptop was unplugged plugged.  It should have help up A LOT LONGER but the cooler itself is still going strong.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the concept but this product just can't beat the heat.. Might be ok for a console but even still the airflow is hardly noticeable. What makes a difference is the pure separation from the surface and device which could be achieved with couple of coasters.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was not impressed by the noise, the cheap plastic, or the fact that is says it will fit a 17\" laptop (which mine is) but doesn't actually. My lap hung far over this cooling pad by a lot. But, I am a gamer, my laptop is big and heavy to accommodate the big fans already in the lap top to keep the unit cool when I am doing a couple hours of gaming on my day off. I just wanted some extra fans to help out my lap top since I've had cheaper lap tops burn out on me because the fans didn't run well or were situated where they couldn't get enough air pulled through to cool the unit.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this because the fans on my new MacBook Pro were going pretty crazy when I was working with video. While I waited I got an app that tracks my CPU temperature, and found that the internal fans were keeping the CPU fairly cool (70 - 80 degrees C under load once they kicked in). Not really what I'm looking for. I'm going to return it and look for something more useful, or maybe just do without one.","positive":0},{"review":"  The description says it has a 2 port USB hub, but it's really 1 port. One of the ports is used to power the hub, so that's not really a port available for devices. The surface material and design allows for good air circulation and heat dispersion. I keep my laptop on it at all time just to keep it cooler in general, and I don't turn the fans on until I start doing something more intense like gaming - nothing serious, just low end graphics stuff because I have a desktop for *real* gaming.","positive":0},{"review":"  Recently bought an MSI GS75 Stealth Laptop for design work and gaming.

Once I had it set up and running, my Wifi signal was reduced to the point that I got completely disconnected twice.  There is no reason to have anything more than the small LED by the power switch.  While the fans are quiet, you can still hear them when they're on.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's good at being a platform, being quiet, and having red lights. That's about where it stops.

I was looking for a truly silent device so will have to return this.Also the 15\" MBP is just about an inch narrower overall than the pad: my sense is that the weight of the Macbook rests more on that thin outer shell than the more rigid edges, which presses down a bit on the surface of the pad and increases the already un-silent noise factor.Not a bad device, but totally didn't work for my setup.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love how quiet it is, nothing beats the silent fans on this, but it seems to come at a cost as it doesn`t push the necessary amount of air to make a reasonable difference in laptop temps while gaming. It would be nice to have fan control and control of the lighting to turn it off but the low price is a decent trade off. The temperature difference with and without the fans is non existent when idling and barely noticeable (a few degrees at most) when under load. It only really helps when using on your lap, on a desk it is not needed.","positive":0},{"review":"  On the left side, at the top, 2nd picture from the top, says \"on off switchable blue LED light\".

And the noise level is pretty low compared to others I've tried. Wish they just had an on off switch for the lights and a little ledge at the bottom. Shame to have to do the mods to such a simple unit.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this to save my Lenovo Yoga when the fan inside it went bad. Apparnetly the Yoga is famous for fans going bad, but otherwise it's a great little lappy. I'm actually here to look for a smaller one by the same manufacturer. I'll keep the smaller one in my computer bag, so that way I can just leave this bigger one connected to my docking station.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just got this today and I am totally impressed with how well it works and how quite this unit is. Definitely worth the money.GamingI'm not a gamer so I can't rank the cooler for that.

After the first one was lost by Amazon, I finally received a replacement in about a week later.  I've never experienced this with other brands, so I was a little disappointed by that.  As a result, I'm planning on using this as a dedicated desk cooling pad for my laptop when it's docked.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a non typical use for this item.I purchased this for the bottom of my mini itx case to help keep it cooler with its bottom panel off, and ths product works great.I would definitely reccomend this product for laptops, or other items.

The only other thing I would wish this product to have is some flip-up guards on the top to prevent laptops from sliding off at higher angles (if not used on a flat table), as the top doesn't really provide any friction.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am not sure how many of reviews are fake where the reviewer got this for free or for a discount, but I paid for it and did not get it for free or for a discount so my review is not biased. This cooling pad isn't anywhere near as good as what the 5-star reviews would have you believe:1.Sent back to Amazon for a refund. Don't waste your time with this cooling pad.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought it in August, now in November and it just randomly stops working--sometimes if I shake it a bit it comes back on but holy cow, this thing is absolutely worthless. I'm not naive, I consider laptop cooliing pads to be fairly disposable items but I do expect to get at least a year or two out of one before it craps out. Three months, that's a record, and not a good one. Save your money, get something that doesn't suck.","positive":0},{"review":"  The good: It keeps my laptop at a reasonable idle temperatureThe bad:After only about 2 months of use, the cooler pad began to make high pitched \"cricket\" like sounds. Another 8 months later it began making a low pitched rumbling sound that was obviously not normal. a bit annoying. In general, stay away from this product unless you can buy it for a much cheaper, more reasonable price for the quantity presented.","positive":0},{"review":"  Noise level is low, and it does have a nice design. However it's performance is low as well.it could also be error on my part for not buying a pad that has the fan placement where my fans are, however moving my laptop to align with the pads fans still did nothing. So I believe that does have something to say about the cooling pads quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like that this cooling pad is slim and very quiet when on, however, the \"anti-skid board\" is literally just a 1mm dip in the metal mesh, so it doesn't prevent my laptop from sliding. The cooling pad works well when doing casual work on my Macbook Pro, but when I'm recording and rendering video, I still have to utilize another external fan to cool my laptop down. I'll keep this product since I like the slim design and the fact that it elevates my laptop to allow for more air circulation underneath, but if you're looking for something with hard-core cooling effects, spend some extra bucks on something more powerful.","positive":0},{"review":"  For casual users that want to avoid sweating when using their laptop on their lap, or take good care of their over-used laptop, it's a great buy for the price, and this pad is a very popular choice. But if you're gaming and need heavy performance - look elsewhere. I guess I was expecting a fan that would push airflow through my laptop's natural cooling channels, but what I got was a pad that evenly and steadily supplied air for the laptop's built-in fans. Does what it's designed to do, I guess, but as I said earlier, if you need performance, look up some proper reviews for suggestions of more heavy-duty cooling pads.","positive":0},{"review":"  First off it doesn't look terrible so that was a plus. My laptop fit on it perfectly another plus but sadly all down hill from there. There is no fan control so that's just it Fans that can't even move a standard sheet of paper. There are better cooler for the price with fan control and high adjustment.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is weak in it's most important task:  cooling the laptop.Find the review here that lists a video of the air flow vs.  Some people are ok with them or do like them, idk, i guess i'm surprised there are very few options that do not have them.  They are obnoxious to me, but just my opinion.","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros: Build quality is great. There are a lot air vents on bottom and sides to let air in.Conclusion: if u want a quite pad that keeps your lap cool then this will work.

Perfect size for a 15 to 17 laptop (or larger).  Excellent product, as described.  5 stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's light weight,  seems to be well built. Quiet and easy to use. I didnt rate it for gaming as I dont game on my laptop.

I can honestly say I never knew such a product existed.  So far so good.  Great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this thing. I`m no gamer or techie, but I have a souped up MacBook that I use for 3D rendering.

It's surprisingly powerful for its price, and the best part of all. It's lightweight, thin enough for travel, has an additional USB port, and an on and off switch. Plus it glows.","positive":1},{"review":"  My work tablet has to run a power intensive software for at minimal 8 hours straight.  Sometimes 10.  But the fans do cool down your computer. Trust me on that one.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was initially not impressed with the fan output when I plugged it in and held my hand over the fans. But after using it for a while, I must admit my laptop is running cooler judging from the heat output of the exhaust fan and the fact that it has not become sluggish since I started using the cooler. Too bad they didn't add a few more, it would have been nice to re-route a few of my cables to make the laptop look less like a spider. Oh, well, at least the laptop is running cooler now.","positive":1},{"review":"  I will update this, if my opinion changes.I am actually really surprised on the build quality and overall quality of this cooler.I would totally recommend this for someone that needs a simple, but affordable, cooler pad for their laptop.If anything changes, I will be sure to update this.","positive":1},{"review":"  i have a gaming laptop that will heat up noticeably and the fans get so loud that you have to turn up the volume..about the only criticism i have, is no high low setting. the reason i say that, is because i notice air flow around the laptop despite the laptop being the same width or slightly wider then the cooler pad, which leads me to believe the laptop simply can't use all the air being pushed towards it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this recently to replace my ten-year-old cooling fan that has officially died and I wish I had this particular one sooner. My laptop is a 17-inch, so it fits perfectly on this pad, with even a bit more \"wiggle room\" than the old one did. I've only had this for a couple of weeks and now I'm able to use my laptop more often and longer than I used to. If you have a big laptop with high processing power, this is an absolute must-have.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my laptop when I play a game it runs at around 90-97\u00b0C. I got this in hopes of lowering that temperature range to at least under 90\u00b0C, but it still runs at 97\u00b0C.Really the only reason I gave it two stars is because it makes a nice surface to lay my laptop on, but doesn't add to the cooling effects at all. I also took out the annoying LED lights.","positive":0},{"review":"  So almost immediately after receiving this I couldn't shake that it felt eerily familiar and it dawned on me that I had bought one years ago and it died on me within a few months. Greeeeat. Ergonomically, it could use improvement as there's no rubber stop to keep the laptop from sliding off it, and the USB cables sticking right out create the risk of accidentally hitting them and breaking your port. I bought a right angle USB converter but the cable should just come with right angle ends.","positive":0},{"review":"  Returning. I'm in need of a GOOD cooling pad for my gaming laptop.

Anyway, thanks to whoever reviewed my review and deemed it unacceptable.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product barely works on my macbook pro 2014. Since the two fans are closer to  the user, the better part of the cooling if for the front of the laptop's base, but for macbooks the back part of the base heats up more, so this doesnt work as well. Its quiet, as in not annoying, but after about 10 minutes the cooling effect was gone because the metal mesh heated up. whats the point in having a metal mesh.","positive":0},{"review":"  Okay I got this because my laptop overheats. And it was also Amazon's Choice. But it is Cheap. So yes I am upset and you should probably not buy this if you want something that works.","positive":0},{"review":"  I appreciate the slim profile, which can be beneficial if you prop your laptop on your lap in bed or something like that. Basic features include a height adjuster to elevate the cooling pad from the back, nice blue lights, and an extra USB port. A bit of a letdown, but hopefully its usefulness will kick in with more intensive usage. Aside from that, I`ve seen no defective issues in the few months that I`ve had this cooling pad so it`s pretty reliable in the long run.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0The cooling pad does its job and prevents my 15 inch MacBook Pro from overheating. The fan is slightly noisy, but I got used to it after a while. It only stays in place if I hook the monitor over the cooling pad`s upper side. This, however, interferes with the view of my external monitors.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got the cooler and the box had clearly already been opened. it was torn and not even closed correctly.I feel like I've been lied to and taken advantage by this company. There was no QC involved nor is the description correct.","positive":0},{"review":"  The unit was pretty quiet and I suppose it worked as advertised, but I wanted something to put on my lap while watching TV (yeah, aren't we all multitasking nowadays.)The laptop cooler kept my lap reasonably cool from my  hot laptop computer, but the surface of the pad is way too slippery..a long chance to see if maybe my actions were the problem, but no, it was the cooler.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this product for almost 800 days until today, when the cable finally broke enough for the fan not to run. I put it through a lot of ware over the last 2 years and actually carried it around in my laptop bag many times. Overall, it was worth the purchase. Would have given 5 stars if not for needing to purchase another cable so soon, despite it lasting over 2 years.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been struggling with product reviews while needing a cooling pad for my laptop. I finally bought this Havit HV-F2056. In both cases I ran multiple apps (but I am not a gamer) while doing several hours of music recoding.Having done this a couple times over weeks, I can tell you, that running this cooling pad and monitoring it`s performance using an app, this pad consistently cools my laptop for hours and days.","positive":1},{"review":"  Compr\u00e9 una laptop hace poco y buscando recomendaciones de base enfriadora, encontr\u00e9 esta Havit.

The on off switch make it easy to leave plugged in and not drain battery if you forget to unplug it, with led lights letting you easily know if it is on or off.

I have not checked for data transfer speeds through the additional USB port which is left after connecting a USB cord to power the fans or if there is a data connection at all. I am using a 15 inch laptop with this unit.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a nice fan cooler for a laptop.  It has enough flow, very quiet and a gentle blue light tells you if it is on or off.  For both my laptops the area that was getting the most cooling was on the opposite side so I have been using it turned around so that legs are in the front.  A relatively minor inconvenience that may not be an issue if your laptop does not get very hot or if the hot area of the laptop is towards the back.","positive":1},{"review":"  This seemingly simple device has a serious weakness: the USB connectors on the back. I used it for a few months, and it's quiet and cools my overheated laptop down nicely. You would have to hold the wire just perfectly for it to make an electrical connection, and a slight touch is enough to lose it. Not sure if it's a manufacturing defect or a design flaw, but it's clear that the build quality of these connectors are so-so.","positive":0},{"review":"  So this whole product kind of confused me. It didn't blow air out so I assumed it just sucked the hot air in and redistributed it outside. Maybe this would work with thinner computers but honestly, it just didn't work the way I wanted it to. It didn't work well enough.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am returning this product but I must leave a review to warn others. I loved everything about this except the fact that it doesn`t actually cool my laptop. Oh well you`ve been forewarned. I don`t know, maybe I got a defective one, but I have nothing to compare it to and the fan blades appear to be moving so I think it just doesn`t do the job.","positive":0},{"review":"  (Updated my review since I've had it for a longer period of time now- the laptop cooler no longer works unless the cord is positioned precisely and held in place)I've had this product for a half a year now and I did like it a lot. It cooled down my older MacBook Pro which would heat up after five minutes of being turned on. (I think the wiring is shot at this point.) I'm buying a new laptop cooling pad and I'm going to try a different one that offers a warranty if it does break (unlike this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  Wow I was so disappointed with the function of this product. Yes it looks cool(annoying how I can`t turn off the led lights though) and keep my computer cool, great. However it`s useless to use with a computer that doesn`t have a completely rubberized bottom. My MacBook Pro slides off after legit 30seconds of being on this thing when it`s in the inclined position, which this item needs to be on to allow enough air underneath to cool your computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had to return this on arrival.  One of the fans did not work.","positive":0},{"review":"  The lights are blindingly bright, and there's no way to turn them off or dim them while the fans are running.

Only reason I'm not rating 1 star is because it does cool the laptop well.","positive":0},{"review":"  So, I ordered this because I really needed it before my travels. I`m not going to do anything about this yet.I just can`t believe how horribly this was handled and shipped. I`m so angry and this is really not okay.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have used this exact model on a different computer in the past. For some reason the unit I jut received is way quieter, not that it's a bad thing, I can immediately tell these fans are much less powerful than the previous version I have used. Really wish there was a speed controller on here for this price or at least a way to boost the fan speed. Do not purchase if you plan on doing anything graphics intensive with your laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  While the image attached to the product listing shows this item with three raised areas at the bottom to keep your laptop from slipping off when raised, the actual product does not have these - having a slightly depressed area where the fans are instead. This may work for smaller laptops (12-13 inches) but for a 15 inch I am having to adjust frequently as the laptop slowly slides down over a session. Am looking for some small pegs or rubber bumpers I can add on since this is one of the lighter stands out there, and it DOES have good airflow. But it all comes to naught if it isn't reliable in use.","positive":0},{"review":"  Have been using for a couple of months now and it's pretty good.  When I first got it, I used it flat on my desk and it didn't do that good a job at cooling my HP laptop.  Couldn't beat the price and it IS very quiet.

Since using this, the device has stopped shutting down due to overheating.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product came in nice packaging and wasn't damaged. The top half where your laptop sits is metal mesh and seems sturdy enough, however the bottom half is thick plastic and seems a bit flimsy where the fan slots are.

I drilled out all the the holes where the small screws were, put in thicker longer ones, and most importantly, put some nuts in there to create more space. If you are so inclined, it's cheap to do and doesn't take very long, but to be honest, I would save yourself the trouble and find a different model that doesn't need all the tweaking.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a very nice product BUT it didn't work to cool off my computer. The packaging it came in was very nice along with the whole product itself.5 inch fans, but seeing as this one was weaker at pushing air, i returned it. The product looks a lot nicer than in the pictures and was good but just not good enough for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I know when I was looking into this item I didn't care about how it looked, I wanted numbers, and you probably do too.For starters you are likely buying this because your laptop is overheating, if you are getting 85C or above, and looking for a miracle, this is not that, you will probably need to undervolt the CPU and consider replacing the thermal paste in addition. Based off my stress tests I got on average about a 5C difference under load, and a 5-10C difference at idle, however the former is more relevant. You cannot adjust fan speeds on this product, this means that although quiet as your CPU and GPU increase in temperature over time under increasing load the pad will slowly lose its effectiveness, and you will reach your usual temperatures, albeit slower, if you have massive overheating issues this is useful, but will only mitigate the issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased just a little over one year ago. Worked well through the year, used every weekday. They have apparently glued the fan to the plastic bottom panel, so no way to replace it that I can see, and I don't think the manufacturer offers replacements. For the price, it's reasonable to replace the entire unit I guess.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have my Asus Zephyrus M and that machine is a beast. It run those games as a champ. x2 anterior and x1 posterior when most of the laptops are x2 fan posterior.

A little attention to detail goes a long way.","positive":1},{"review":"  Perfect. I use my gaming laptop for sims 4. Fan is also so quiet that I have to double check to make sure it`s on since I can`t hear it. :) the lights on the fan are literally pointless so if they don`t have the color you want in stock, just buy another color.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really had no idea why people would buy things like this until my computer started to get old. One day while sitting and doing my work my laptop overheated and completely shut down. It is saved my life and on my laptop works great.

I was getting pretty high temperatures for the CPU while playing games reaching into the 85 C+. However I do agree that there should have been at least an option to turn the lights off.I don't think this will be effective with every Gaming Laptop, but with mine it worked fine, and if you're not using your laptop for gaming I think it'll be even better.","positive":1},{"review":"  I cannot find my old review....","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently order this because of overheating concerns on my laptop.I was concerned because of the price point. The one downside is that the fans seem to lack power compared to other more expensive devices I've used. For mid-tier gaming laptops or just work or school laptops this will definitely get the job done if you have a major heating concern spend a little more for something with more power.","positive":1},{"review":"  This cooling pad is quiet. It's a little over an inch thick, which is acceptable. I remedied this by using electrical tape to attach the cord to the pad from the back over to the side, but feel this is a very easy issue to resolve by the manufacturer, and I shouldn't have to resort to tape. For these reasons the item is \"good\", but not great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this laptop cooling pad for a couple of weeks.  The old one I had (purchased in 2013) wasn't working so well anymore, so I got this one to try out, and it is exactly what I needed.  Depending on your laptop material, it could shift or somewhat slide down on the pad, so just something to be mindful of so your laptop doesn't slide off if it's on the edge of a table.  Otherwise it's great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a student, so I'm basically on my laptop from sun up til well past sundown while on zoom for class or discord to talk with friends. My laptop would get so hot that I wouldn't be able to set it on my legs while I was in bed. Literally wasn't an issue at all and the cord reached perfectly. This is truly a 10 10 purchase and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a cooling pad for their laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  On the first one I bought, one of the fans doesn't work.  I ordered a replacement, and all of the fans work on it.  That being said, I ended up using both this Havit cooler and the Opolar cooler, and an overheating laptop is no longer an issue.  However, that dual set up is best for laptops that don't travel much.","positive":0},{"review":"  If only I could go back in time and tell myself to not waste money on this..The only good thing is the pretty blue light that distracts my toddler..","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a handy cooler, it works pretty well, keeps my computer from thermal throttling and restarting after hours of gameplay, but it still doesnt keep it very cool. The usb broke after a few months, but thank god there are two.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had to build a ridge on the bottom, laptops just slide off of it.  There's no 'catch' or ridge built in so everything slides off .. it's NOT no slip, mine is actually FULL SLIP, the paint is slippery and everything slides off.","positive":0},{"review":"  I used this with my macbook. Initially, out of the box, it worked. I'm looking at getting another one, but not from here. The difference in efficiency between week 1 and week 4 is ridiculous.","positive":0},{"review":"  It works kind of well but there are a few flaws I found. You can't customise how powerful the cooling is, it is just one setting and on and off. Overall, it's good but just barely. and since it does it part of not letting my laptop suffocate in heat, I can't complain much.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this for my gaming laptop to avoid overheating as often, or to at least drop the temperature a few degrees. While it's built well, has some extra USB slots that are handy, and it lifts the laptop off a desk for more air flow, the actual fan function itself is basically useless. If you want something as a \"laptop rest\" then this is great. If you want it to cool your laptop, I'd look elsewhere.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall 1 star, if you want a laptop cooler to look the part with some cool lights and not actually so anything useful this is for you. There`s no baffling or channeling inside the pad to direct air up towards the laptops so the second you cover the top the air just gets moved around inside, I tested this with a thin piece of plastic on the side vent which was supposed to be sucking air was actually blowing it out. Tested and proved my laptop actually stays cooler on its own sitting flat then by using this. Much better off with a stand-alone fan running off a wall outlet instead of draining my laptop battery faster for some fancy light show.","positive":0},{"review":"  Doesn't do much to cool and stopped working after less than a year. I bought it to replace a Tree New Bee cooler that started getting wonky and making noise. Don't waste your money if you're playing on a gaming laptop. If you just need some distance between your crotch and your laptop, it's probably fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  The power port on the cooling pad is a USB-A to USB-A. I've never seen one of these cables in my life before this, and had to order one specifically for this, seperately. it won't even turn on, no matter how its plugged in. Complete rip-off.","positive":0},{"review":"  SUGGESTION TO DIM LIGHTS: I unscrewed the back panel and cut tiny strips of electrical tape to cover the lights (I crisscrossed 2 strips of 3mm tape pieces). I had to add the tapes with 2 tweezers since I couldn`t figure out how to remove the fans. But it stays put for the most part when I`m using it. The LED blue lights are also super bring and you can`t turn them off.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is about the size of a laptop and fits perfectly below my ASUS Zephyrus 15\". It uses a single USB2 to USB2 cable to connect to your laptop with a toggle power switch controlling it.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the cooling pad. The fact that's is very quiet, compact, and can keep temps down about 10F is a huge boon for gaming laptops (my last ASUS died from too much heat stress due to poor air flow around the MB).","positive":1},{"review":"  I teach online for at least 5 hours a day 7 days a week. After teaching, I spend all day working on graduate assignments.One drawback - my Macbook Air fell off the cooling pad when it was angled and I didn`t position it carefully. You need to watch your placement - it shifts easily.","positive":1},{"review":"  After my 9 year old laptop crashed from overheating, I decided to buy this cooling pad. It saved me from another crash today, when I felt the overheating come on during a video conference. If you drag the unit across a white surface it will leave streak marks.Overall, a great device and would absolutely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  Our family owns several different cooling pads, and to date this has to be the best one we have owned.  Love how light weight it is, but so sturdy.  I love the soft blue lights that are built into the frame giving it such a cool relaxing glow.  Wish I could leave a photo or two with my review, but looks like Amazon has taken that feature off the product review section, sorry.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to help my computer not overheat during game night. My MacBook used to lose its mind trying to run Tabletop simulator, now it stays cool and I don't have to force-quit everything else on my computer for game nights.. Had no idea these things could actually make such a huge difference.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm fairly new to PC gaming, and I knew that laptops tend to heat up quite a bit while doing so. I scoured the internet for weeks looking for quality laptop cooling pads, and continuously saw this one mentioned. I knew that plugging in a cooling pad into my laptop while gaming would only drain the battery faster, so I used a double ended USB cord, plugged that into a phone charger, and it worked like a charm.I would definitely recommend getting this, as it works very well (YouTube videos have shown a 10+ degree difference).","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought one for my modem and router, and it is very quiet compared to cheap USB fans I bought from discount store. Then I bought another one for my laptop, but one of its fans died. I could easily turn it around, but then the USB kind of in a way (the cable is under my wrist), and I cannot use the legs to tilt it.Overall, I would recommend this 100% to anyone who needs cooling fan.","positive":1},{"review":"  Runs very quiet. appears to be keeping the laptop running cooler evidenced by the laptop fan not going to high speed as often while gaming.  Wish it had a smart switch that turned the cooler on and off with the laptop.  Always seem to forget to turn it off.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was having a problem with my Samsung \"One Connect Box\" overheating and turning off my UHD 4k TV so I thought that I should give this cooling platform a try. My TV box happens to be the exact same width as a computer but it is a little shallower. My only complaint is that I wish that I could turn the blue LED lights off as they can be slightly distracting while watching TV. Good product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I thought this fan would help with my laptop overheating, but it did not. I think this product is only built for certain laptops that require plenty of ventilation from the bottom. It's a nice product and I like the led, gives you the reminder that it's one. I did not like the quality of the material though, if felt cheap, and the long usb cable adds more cables to your desk that you don't need.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am not new to cooling products, but I haven't had to buy a laptop cooler for about 10 years.  Figured I would give this one a try since I couldn't find one available from Zalman, Thermaltake, or CoolerMaster.)  Very disappointed.  Returning for a refund.","positive":0},{"review":"  It worked fine being used on a daily basis for about 4 or 5 months. During the 6th month, sometimes it would work if the cable was in a certain position, but sometimes not. I would raise the score for the Havit to 4 if not for this cable issue. Not sure of the cost of a cable, but you can extend the life of the Havit with a new cable.","positive":0},{"review":"  I can't praise the visual presentation of this cooling pad enough, it looks as beautiful in real life as in the pics.However, function is the important aspect.The inputs on my model were poorly-made or something. They are shaky and don't maintain connection at all anymore.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product has a nice design, but it is noisy due to the fan motors' obsolete technology. Those fans use single-phase brushless DC motors, and they have rough commutation processes. So the fans make ticking noises as they turn due to the commutations the motors make. This product should use three-phase brushless motors for the fans, which run smoother and generate a lot less noise during commutation processes.","positive":0},{"review":"  Since this was delivered, it has been used daily. It's been working well and it's great as a lapdesk.. Hope this isn't normal, and hoping especially that the rest of the pad doesn't break down in bits and pieces.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was very unsatisfied with the amount of air this thing producess, barely provided any cooling if any at all, I would not recommend this for a high end laptop inneed of extra cooling, I would moreso recommend this to someone who is looking for minimum cooling and as a surface to put your laptop on and set on your lap.","positive":0},{"review":"  Granted, it is getting a lot more use over the last 4 months due to the 100% telework due to COVID-19.  I was able to silence the noise by raising the cooling pad a couple of inches, and then dropping it onto the desk.  :)  Not the best method of fixing things, but worked well for silencing the noise for a couple days at a time.  The lift and drop method is not working for more than a few seconds now.","positive":0},{"review":"  The unit will only work-and not too well, by purchasing something to keep your laptop from sliding off into your lap, or worse, crashing to the ground. Try placing gluing small felt pads at the edge of the unit closest to you.Several years ago this was one of the only companies making this type of product. Lucky for us, there are now numerous companies with much better products out there to chose from.","positive":0},{"review":"  Is it quiet. Yes. I've had this pad on all day and I may as well have never purchased it for all the good its done. Just a piece of pretty junk.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really only got this because my mom pressured me into it because she says it protects your lap against radiation and she really wants more grandkids.  I have no way of verifying if it actually does that (nor plans for grandkids but ask me in 5-10 years and we'll see where life is at) but what I can tell you is that it does keep the computer cool and also your lap as you can feel a slight breeze on your legs. first of all why is your laptop so big.  Secondly, you probably will need something bigger.","positive":1},{"review":"  When looking for a cooling pad, the two most important things to me were whether it would fit comfortably on my lap for gaming in the recliner, and whether it would keep my legs from getting hot, and wow does this thing deliver.Laptop:  I'm seeing a good 10 degrees C difference on my CPU readings due to this thing at best.6\" laptop that feels like a perfect fit and I feel like a 17\" laptop might be a bit too large and would have parts hanging over the edge of the cooling pad. YMMV based on the laptop of course.","positive":1},{"review":"  The game that brought me to buy this is Civ. That game burns up my laptop within 10 minutes of playing to a point where it begins to lag so bad that its barely playable. Seriously, I can play Civ for hours when I have this plugged in. The only thing I'm not too happy about is that this drains the battery pretty quickly, but Civ does that too, so I already have my laptop charging.","positive":1},{"review":"  Last year, my computer repair guy recommended one of these. He said a good percentage of laptop failures were from overheating because there's so little air circulation--especially if you actually have them on your lap, which obstructs the vents on the bottom.The entire bottom of my laptop is absolutely cool to the touch when using it. Much better product for a few extra bucks.","positive":1},{"review":"  This cooling pad is a little bulky, but to fit all those fans inside I totally understand why. I mostly leave this on my desk at home, so it's size hasn't really been a problem.The only reason that I am taking one star off is that the description for the item advertises that the extra USB port on the back of the pad can be used as a USB hub, but my computer does not recognize anything that I plug into the port. This hasn't really been a problem for me however since I already have a USB-C hub that I use for my laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  So on the weekends my son usually spends 3 or 4 hours per day straight gaming with his friends.

Great value for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just bought a new Dell laptop with a ssd that cost me a lot of $$$. I don't even know if I needed this, but I figured it couldn't hurt to get just to make sure it stays cool. So if it lasts anywhere near that long, it'll be more than worth it, if it doesn't, I'll see how they handle the warranty. I have a 14\" laptop on it that has backlit keyboards , but with the blue led's I could use the laptop in a pitch black room, I'm happy with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a good purchase, it works very well to cool my older Mac laptop, and is very quiet.  The ONLY thing that keeps it from getting a 5-star rating from me is the lack of a lip on the front edge to keep the laptop from slipping forward.  A lip would be a good design improvement.  Overall though I would still recommend this one to anyone else.","positive":1},{"review":"  I noticed my MBP fan running full steam and my computer bogging down due to heat issues - combine that with a sometimes hot, humid climate and it really puts a strain on your computer.I will say this fan really helps my computer perform, Ive seen tests on youtube that show that these fans do almost nothing to the temperature of the computer but in this case I think it works.Ive owned it for awhile now and often forget to turn it off but its still running strong and quiet. The only option that would be nice is to turn off the blue lights otherwise Im super happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Writing this review as a warning to others. The unit itself works exactly as advertised, and will keep a laptop cooler than nothing, but it is missing two key features. The second is that there is no ridge flip arm to keep the laptop on the cooling pad. When using the back legs to angle the laptop it is very susceptible to slipping off the pad.","positive":0},{"review":"  it works I guess.  not as good as I was expecting, in fact it probably doesn't reduce the heat more than a couple degrees.so take it for what it is.  for myself, it is a letdown.","positive":0},{"review":"  Even though it has three fans, the amount of noticeable effective airflow in one direction feels quite negligible.  when placed flat on a surface, it barely moved or lifted a sheet of paper.

However,  people who are not comfortable with installing a clean copy of Windows 10 (or upgrading the ram to 8 gigs) will be dissatisfied with this laptop. If you take it somewhere for this to be done, you should plan on spending around $100-ish.Once the bloatware issue is resolved, this is really a great laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall this laptop is above average for the price range. For starters, it takes less than 5 minutes to change it from Windows 10s mode to normal (You're even given a prompt as soon as the initial setup is complete), otherwise it's just a 10 second google search. Many of the issues can be rectified with little to no money, and for it's price, I would definitely recommend it to people who want a college business recreational laptop, but do not want to break the bank. (note: for gaming, it can run simple games like minecraft, Roblox, LoL at 35-45 fps med-high settings.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a decent laptop and it does a nice job in basic computing like Internet, email, etc. It's not your \"speed demon\" and not a \"gaming machine,\" but it's fine for a student or somebody who doesn't do much more than web browsing..)To make this long story short, this particular laptop is fine as long as you manage to switch it from this silly S Mode to regular Windows 10.","positive":1},{"review":"  What a pleasant surprise.

CI called lenovo tech support I was told that 1 have to pay $34 -$  99to ship the laptop to get it fixed eventhough the lap top only 3 months old and still under warranty what a lousy tech support they have. The worst tech support I will not recommend lenovo to anybody. Please avoid lenovo youwill regret it for your entire life.","positive":0},{"review":"  When opening the Laptop, and setting it up, i was surprised on how light it was. We all own lenovo laptops in our household, however this one was a let down. If your a student and need a laptop for programming, you may be limited on what you can install and run on the laptop. However, lenovo offers turning off Windows 10s mode, but if you do so, it states that you can not get it back.","positive":0},{"review":"  Buyer Beware. This is a limited version of windows.

I did not find the computer to be all that slow (especially working online- plenty fast, though loading new programs did take a few seconds) but my husband bought a single stick 8G memory to upgrade- so that is an affordable option if that is important to you. Even upgrading the memory, I couldn't find more value in another laptop- especially since the CD drive burner was a priority for us.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can't believe how nice it really is. This was a refurbished unit.

It was easy to set up and did not come with nearly as much \"bloatware\" as an HP laptop.  I don't think she minds, but I prefer a more vivid display for my own use.

UPS here I come.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not bad for the price, but there were some issues. The biggest is the Lenovo DVD app for playing DVDs kept crashing.If you are looking for something inexpensive to browse the web and are not ready to commit to a Chromebook, this is probably a decent choice.

I did not believe that the kind of errors that I encountered were worth trying another unit, as my recent experience with a bluetooth mouse was incredibly bad, after two tries to reconcile the defect. Overall, I thought the speed of the unit was adequate, but the functionality of having all the USB ports on the left side of the computer was awkward, especially for using a corded mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  Extremely slow, loading simple webpage seems to overload the CPU and whole machine starts lagging.

Battery life is good, display is crisp and bright, seems sturdy. I've never been a fan of a touchpad (Lenovo or any other), but a $10 mouse takes care of that.

I like the look and feel of the laptop and it is fast and \"feels\" much like the HPs that I have used for years.  The battery is not a big issued for us since we can keep the power cord plugged in.

The mouse is really annoying to use. Terrible, cheap parts.","positive":0},{"review":"  This new laptop is very fast, works well on wifi, very light to carry around. (con) more usb ports would have been better, but I just brought a hub and it works well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I cannot say how much I despise Windows 10 and the terrible \"helping\" popups associated the windows program and MSN  The continuing plague of popup ads and overcrowding ad space on the screen are horrible.  BUT the computer is still great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had two laptops, two latitudes, one chromebook and this Lenovo Ideapad performs as good as my dell 3000 series laptop. I only have this Lenovo for a month so only time will tell if this Ideapad is as good as my previous laptops but so far, I am happy with it...","positive":1},{"review":"  Exactly what I spent my entire life searching for. I look forward to greatness in the next few years. Greater than ever before.","positive":1},{"review":"  My new Lenovo was everything I wanted in a PC at a price that was almost too good to be true.  What else can you say.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall easy set up computer battery life is pretty good i like Windows display but I'm trouble with playing a DVD in this laptop other then that it's a good laptop. Can someone please me further out how to please DVD in the drive please i would really appreciate it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Quick to boot, responsive, bright and clear screen, and good battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  my laptop was delivered 12 10 2019, however, renewal of the warranty was offered with an expiration of 5 04 2020. I had been trying to contact the company via e-mail but it keeps saying that my email is undeliverable. A couple of weeks back, I received the offer of extending the warranty, however, on the email there was no means to dispute the dates or expiration, hence, the warranty expired according to the email.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this when I got my first client. It is very efficient, however, I know I will be buying another one. I need more memory for my files. It is very good and I highly recommend it for a start-up company.","positive":1},{"review":"  The battery life is pretty terrible, the trackpad is infuriating, I can see two stuck pixels at all times, the fan is loud and kicks on almost immediately upon use, and 4GB of RAM is far too little.That said, it's good for school and basic web browsing.Yeah, this is a budget laptop. But that's not such a terrible thing when you're on a budget.","positive":1},{"review":"  Return initiated....","positive":0},{"review":"  Received the computer on April 20th. It  worked as expected with no issues until June 30th. There was no sign of overheating at any point. The power supply unit simply broke with no warning.","positive":0},{"review":"  I returned this laptop one day after I purchased it. The DVD tray was very flimsy and rattled when playing a DVD. The display was dim and the sound from the speakers was very soft even at full volume. Yes, I was buying a laptop at the low end of the Lenovo product line but, come on, you can do better than this.","positive":0},{"review":"  It works OK until I begin playing online games, which turns this computer into a piece of crap.  It would crash when I play an online game that requires usage of ABode Reader (or whatever they call it nowadays).  Also, its response time is terrible because when I type commands or participate in chat, it takes more than 10 seconds for it to process my command comments.  Looking forward to the day when it breaks down so that I can replace it with something else.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use this for freelance work. It's just ok. Still it boots up very quickly which is nice, and seems secure. So, for the money it is just ok.","positive":0},{"review":"  I chose this computer because 1) I was used to the IBM design and therefore my learning curve was less steep and 2) because it was within my price range.  However the people who set up computers--- and this one is no exception-- seem to grow more stupid each year.  It also, despite my correcting the settings continues to believe that this 87 year old man is a \"child.\" who needs to get parental approval  Finally, a general criticism that applies to the whole PC industry:  it continues to be enslaved to the peculiarity to Microsoft nervous twitches that mandate more system pop-ups every year and presume that when a cursor approaches a clickable spot, it means to go there and does so before the click-- and other more annoying features.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this as general purpose machine to use when traveling or needing to be away from my desk top.  While I like the weight and the screen, there are three things that I don't like (so far).  The DVD player keeps locking up.  When it does, nothing works including the close or minimize buttons.","positive":0},{"review":"  It seems that when windows update this machine there it never deleted the old update files. I have few thing but the original windows and software and have deleted all temp files but this states i am out of space. I have had this for  just over a year and have no videos or pictures but it tells me i am out of space. I realize it is only 120 g but even with only the pre-package software i should be no where close to even half full.","positive":0},{"review":"  Wish I had read previous reviews a little closer before I bought this computer. Unless I am doing something wrong, I have found this laptop to be the slowest computer I have ever used. I don't know if it's the SSD or processor or what. Future buyers, check really good before you decide to buy this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  The AC adapter power cord for this computer is 6 foot stretched to maximum.  My older laptop power court is about 32 inches longer.Lenovo, I ought to return this product to Amazon simply for the laughably short power cord you included.  What a negative way to start the unboxing experience of the new product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Was looking for something with the bare necessities for a first laptop. This works just fine for for what I needed. Only complaint I have is battery life. About 2 hours tops.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Delivery was perfect. Got it a day before, was very impressed. Came in Windows 10 S mode but was very easy to change. Battery life is okay.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice laptop for the price. Does what was intended which was use for remote office connection and video conferencing. Not running anything that would push the processor.  Seller helpful and nice to work with.","positive":1},{"review":"  I do a lot of repairs and Lenovos are the easiest to work on. This is a good low end laptop ideal for young ones and occasional users. I highly recommend it for those people.","positive":1},{"review":"  No this is not a touch screen but fictional very well. I don't have issues with this laptop although I wanted something smaller I guess I didn't take into consideration the size. Otherwise, it is a very functional device.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this with a Black Friday deal and I can say this is the best computer I have ever owned.  It's fast, reliable, and my children have not broken it yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  Arrived sooner than expected.  Laptop was a gift for granddaughter therefore have no personal knowledge as to performance at this time, although my much older Lenovo laptop still works just fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the laptop size and weight but find the right an left click buttons are stiff and kind of hard to use. I decided to buy a mouse and keep the laptop.Everything else works great. Great display, and really fast.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the price paid it's a good buy. This review will be updated as I plan to upgrade the RAM and HDD. It does come in Windows S mode which is a pain when it comes to installing applications. However, it's easy and free to switch to Windows 10 home edition.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product that was offered at a great price. The gift recipient was very appreciative. Highly recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  It has a too many preloaded applications, first 2 days the notebook was super slow and it took a toll on my workload. It has sense speed up a hit but is a great laptop for the price. Its light and easy to travel with. I do suggest optimizing and maybe removing some of the non essential apps so that you have a better experience then me.","positive":0},{"review":"  i suppose for the price I shouldn't be complaining, and I'm not, just a little disappointed. On the things that I like: full keyboard, quick-start, decent screen quality. But at this point it would just make sense to find something else a little better.  My rating should be between: It's not bad but it's not good either, it's just meh.","positive":0},{"review":"  I paid $236.00 for this in December and was blown away by what that price is now 8 months later. Purchased it for my Dad and he has now passed. Donating it to a local non profit that helps homeless families get re-established.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product does not have the English keyboard - missing \u00a3 sign. Different position for @It also doesn't have a UK charger it appears to be (as suggested by the Local IT specialist in Albox) Canadian .Due to it not having been shipped (I'm assuming ) from UK it ended up stuck in customs who wouldn't release without the completion of a form signed and returned  so instead of a delivery date of 28th of June it was received by me on 9th July 2019 after being left at some random persons flat.I have yet to use this product but not a good start.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this pc to replace an old pc. I have been very disappointed by this purchase: it is very slow for ordinary works like documents edits, multiple window pages, and Wi-Fi is unstable (signal level oscillating in big ways). We have multiple pcs at home, and everybody of the family tried to avoid using this one. Sighs.","positive":0},{"review":"  The computer has quit.  The on button does not operate any longer as of today.  Please be advised that if you need a laptop for a year, then this product is for you.","positive":0},{"review":"  You guys can't just let these refurbished laptops get sent right back out to be sold.  This laptop has moments where it turns on just fine, but other times, even after charging way more than it should have to in order to turn on, there doesn't seem to be anything in the world that could convince the thing to turn on.  Every once in a while I can use this laptop, but most of the time the best it can do is to hold loose papers down solid.  Not what I had hoped of it, certainly.","positive":0},{"review":"  An ok laptop but the picture quality is low. For an additional 50 dollar buy the  Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop, 15...","positive":0},{"review":"  Nice looking computer. I've waited a long time to buy this.  There is no WiFi connection on this computer.  If I can't get it to connect by Tuesday, I don't know what else to do other than to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is the worst computer I have ever bought. The computer worked for about 1-2 months after that it shoot down the screen won`t turn on, I contact the seller but he keeps telling me to reinstall windows 10...","positive":0},{"review":"  Functions as supposed to. My wife likes it as she just does Internet stuff. A good price. Would buy again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve had this laptop for about 3 months. I`ve been using it mostly for school purposes. The only down sides are the screen quality, ram, and battery life, but it`s to be expected do to the price point. Over all it`s perfect for me and gets the job done.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am writing this review on this laptop I ordered and I am very, very satisfied. Thanks, it is all I expected and more...","positive":1},{"review":"  Performs really well as expected. Nice, light, full featured, priced right.  Does everything I`ve asked it to do, but I`m sure it`s not a gamers or engineers dream machine:).","positive":1},{"review":"  Was bought as a road trip pc for the wife. She likes it and it seems to work just fine. Fast and graphics are OK. For the money it was a good purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Easy set up. Switched from 10S to 10 took awhile but easy. Eventually the download was successful and the default changed to Chrome. I use a Lenovo for business daily so am familiar with its features.","positive":1},{"review":"  Needed to run Microsoft Office products and QuickBooks. Has sufficient power and storage for our needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  good quality for a good price.  For the avg user this will fit the bill. If you are a heavy user or intense gamer though, this might not work for you.  The only thing I don't like is the pop-up ads for different products.","positive":1},{"review":"  This low-cost PC was perfect for its limited usage.  I was surprised at the feel and look considering how low the price was.","positive":1},{"review":"  Easy to use computer , lightweight. This laptop is replacing a 6 year old Lenovo that gave me great service , and I expect the same from this one.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this computer for my 9 yr old. just to get her introduced  in using a computer, with that being said i dident want to spend a whole lot of money doing so .","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this for a relative as a gift, and unfortunately found out after six weeks that it won't stay connected to the internet for more than a few minutes at a time, if it connects at all. None of the fixes found on the internet worked, and it's too late to return this dud. It was purchased for the sole purpose of streaming content, and now it's useless. Buyer beware.","positive":0},{"review":"  Slowest laptop known to man. Believe me when I say that this laptop is slow. It takes forever to open just the browser and a century to load a page.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I bought this computer I was under the assumption that it was a touch screen, which was a must for what I need. I searched touch green lap tops and this one came up.  It is NOT a touch screen, therefor I am out of the $255 I paid for it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Laptop came unable to do anything but browse the internet. It comes in S mode and to get out of S mode you need to be able to open the windows store which was not even installed on the laptop. The only way I'm finding to install it is with another app which I can't get because I don't have the windows store.","positive":0},{"review":"  Will not recommend this to anyone.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received the first laptop and it seemed fine at first. We connected the laptop to the TV via HDMI cable and the laptop screen went haywire and got 3 large  black circles on it and a bunch of lines through the screen. Within a few days, the keys stopped working. We cannot even get in because we cannot enter the password to unlock it b c the letter keys don't work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this computer then wasnt ready to switch over from the old one so it sat for a month, When I did set it up the battery would not charge had to send the computer to the company for them to replace the battery. Shipping was over 50 bucks out of pocket. The seller would not deal with the problem because it was past the warrenty period. So will not be buying from them again because they dont stand behind their products.","positive":0},{"review":"  The worst computer that I have ever bought in my life.First to DVD CD drive door broke.The laptop buttons are awkward left to right.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I received the computer and opened the box and turned it on.. It took the seller two weeks from the time that they received the item back at their warehouse to issue a refund to me. I don't be purchasing anything else from them.","positive":0},{"review":"  My old laptop, was just that...the Lenovo meets my needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  PC was a Christmas present for my wife. She loves the PC.IMHO a great bargain.  I'm very happy with the purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  THIS IS JUST WHAT MY GRAND DAUGHTER NEEDED TO DO HER HOMEWORK AND ALL OF HER OTHER TEEN AGE YEARS NEEDS.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great laptop.  The SSD makes load time in under 5 seconds and it's ready to go.  Really great value and integrates great with my monitor via HDMI.  Very happy with this machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great price for such a great laptop. Perfect for email and surfing the web. Not recommended for intense gaming.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a very nice laptop. It runs well (and fast too), but the battery life is only about 2 hours. It is a great laptop for school but the short battery life can be a limiting factor.","positive":1},{"review":"  fast shipping   have not been able to get touch screen to work but the rest of the computer makes me happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pretty good deal but Microsoft's overbearing and controlling set up is disgusting. I have always liked Lenovo though.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m really happy with this but I wish it had Office. I`m not real tech savvie but I need to do basic things and this is working perfectly.","positive":1},{"review":"  Replaced a several year old ASUS laptop with this.  Wife uses it mostly and say it is, \"Awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  Six months in and this computer just died.  No warning.  Huge disappointment as I ONLY used this for my CRICUT machine.  Ugh.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`ve had the  laptop since January. Only 6 months. The mic stopped working and the camera is a bit fuzzy. Attending virtual meetings is now done on my phone.","positive":0},{"review":"  I generally really liked the laptop itself. It was easy to use and provided all the features I needed for basic computing. I have contacted the third party seller but never heard back. Very disappointed in the quality of customer service by this seller and obviously upset about my new laptop being rendered completely useless.","positive":0},{"review":"  I needed a cheap laptop for my mom for Christmas, just so she could watch DVD and listen to cds. She used it less than two weeks before a piece of the charger broke off into the computer. I've left numerous messages trying to get this solved and still no reply, I will not pay $221 for work on a $249 laptop. Worse experience ever, I will never by another Lenovo.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am so unhappy with this laptop... I am very angry about this.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for a cheap laptop for using the internet and watching YouTube but it cant even do that YouTube stutters and lags terribly using the internet feels like 1998 again and the screen quality looks like it was projected onto a matt finish wall it's all around slow I bought a cheap $200 laptop at walmart and its 10x better than this thingIf I had to say 1 good thing about it that would be that it started up pretty quick but that's it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The microphone is defective on this computer.  I have spent way too much time trying to solve this issue with both Lenovo and a computer repair company.  I should not be having a problem this early in the game. I only purchased this computer 6 months ago.","positive":0},{"review":"  Lightweight laptop with an ok screen.  Within a few weeks the device would no longer power on.  Between work and family I have had dozens of laptops over time and haven't ever had anything have complete failure so fast.  I would not recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't know what happened, but after one charge the laptop would not charge again. Be wary of what you plug this laptop into as it may kill it. Not sure if this laptop is right for anyone, really. Just beware of the pitfalls when you purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  There is nothing to like about this product if you can't use the touch pad.  I have an older model of the same computer with raised left and right cursor buttons, in fact I'm typing on it now.  The other issue has nothing to do with Lenovo it has to do with Microsoft 10 which does everything in it's power to keep you from using Google as you default browser.  On the whole one is too high a score.","positive":0},{"review":"  Return this after day decided I really didn't mean it but it was a nice computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this laptop to replace an older Dell model. I like the slim design and reasonable weight of the Lenovo. and so far I really like the performance.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sluggish at times a great at others , got a very good price on it and arrived very quick very satified.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  I haven`t been able to try it out with high speed Internet but I can already tell that this is a huge improvement to my last laptop and cheaper too. Great price on a prime day deal and a good product that works quickly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm still learning how this works.  First thing I like about it.  Its faster than my old ones.","positive":1},{"review":"  Easy to set up. Display us bright and the color is very good..  Will definitely buy again.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it...","positive":1},{"review":"  De muy buena calidad, es ideal para estudiantes no apta para juegos.","positive":1},{"review":"  Perfect for what I wanted. When I had an issue seller was crazy fast responding and super helpful.","positive":1},{"review":"  Slow computer. Bad battery life. Don`t buy this. Save your money for a real laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Can someone please help me. I ordered this for my kids to do online schooling during this sit down. But all of a sudden the screen just went blank. I can log in but once I go to anything like settings it goes to a dark screen.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product is geared toward grade school age. I believe this is a great starter computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  The size was perfect for my daughter's school work. Screen quality acceptable. Fully charged or not. I will be in touch with manufacturer and update based on their response or lack thereof.","positive":0},{"review":"  I will not order another lenovo.  Trying to get rid of Windows 10 s for me is a nightmare.  Needed a simple computer but when I could not get other websites to download it became useless to me.  And the annoying voice is awful when you are trying to hurry.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got half way through the verbal instructions and looked for written instructions. No ENGLISH. Next day turned on the laptop and the name Carol Duncon came up. Uncomfortable.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good laptop for general use. Bat life and enough power for your every day use. Almost impossible to install a new OS. Also all the typical stuff you've heard about Lenovo turns out to be true.","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought this computer was great just for schoolwork then I unplugged it. I couldn't get through a 4 paragraph, 400 word report without the vaterry dying. Horrible battery life and it's also extremely slow.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop has had problem after problem since I received it. It is crazy slow, it freezes, it has issues connecting and then staying connected to the internet. It got to the point where I just didn't use it much, but now, with the laptop being needed more than ever during this Covid-19 crisis, it's very frustrating. Stay away from this device.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product wasn`t as advertised it said it had windows 10 but in reality is was 10s which make a big difference for gdown loading certain products.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use this laptop primarily now. It's sturdy and not as heavy as it could be. It works much better than I thought it would. Processing power leaves a bit to be desired for games.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far so good. It was easy for this senor citizen to set up.  My husband says it responds quickly and works well for his email, searches and games.","positive":1},{"review":"  It doesn't come with much by it is a good quality computer for the money and suits the purpose for which I bought it.","positive":1},{"review":"  My boyfriend owns a computer shop and says this is a pretty good laptop. And that's says a lot coming from him.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loved it.  It was exactly what she wanted..","positive":1},{"review":"  it is not touch screen at all, the camera quality is not good. The battery does not last long. Everything else is good.

Low battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for grandson for Christmas, he is very happy with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  We are thrilled with this lap top.  I don't know about battery life as we don't use it away from home.  A friend said she was happy with her Lenovo.  We didn't know anything about that name but glad we bought the lap top.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works as described.","positive":1},{"review":"  The 1st one I got didn't work received a new one today the setup was fast an very easy no delays sending the 1st one back.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good for just browsing and word processing, but don't expect \"high performance\". It's pretty slow in comparison to previous laptops and has trouble switching from one task to the next. Sometimes even switching between tabs on a browser gives it some difficulty and produces a lag. Tried to use this computer for some video editing and found it impossible.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's not terrible. By no means is this is a very good computer at all though. Save the money, browse the internet on your phone. That's all this laptop is good for anyway.","positive":0},{"review":"  Stopped working after 3 weeks. Couldn`t turn it off and on. We sent it back with our files on it. We`re worriedly about who had access.","positive":0},{"review":"  We purchased this computer for our children to use for their schooling. The dvd drive would not work and so the computer was useless to us. We had two guys that work in tech support look at it and both tried multiple things to fix the problem and neither could and both said it`s a defective dvd drive.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am not used to a laptop quite this slow.  It is very light which I appreciate and the battery life seems good.","positive":0},{"review":"  whatever the product description says, the battery life on this machine is terrible. seriously. kinda' loaded down with unnecessary stuff and kind of clunky to use but it's an inexpensive product and performs fairly well for the price. But oh that battery thing-.","positive":0},{"review":"  Other than malfunctioning now and again most of the keys now dont work.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broke at day 32. Called tech support and it was faulty, but apparently it the purchaser`s responsibility to pay for the shipping.. don`t buy this.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop should be classified as a desktop since it has to be plugged in 95% of the time.

Battery life is also a disappointment. Otherwise it is a good value for it's price point.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this laptop, and can`t beat the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's hard to find a laptop with a CD drive anymore and I needed one. Price was a big plus as this laptop was very low priced. But the new touchpad design is awful, hard to use and sometimes stops working altogether.

I highly recommend this to anyone ready to break down walls, bridge gaps, and create newfound friendships.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Pocketalk is easy to set up and easy to use. I've tested it with native and fluent Japanese speakers, and they confirmed the accuracy of the English-to-Japanese translations. There was one slip-up with an Japanese-to-English translation in which it incorrectly translated one English word, but the Japanese words on the screen were correct. Overall, I feel this is going to be a useful tool when communicating with the locals.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Pocketalk translator is amazing and just what I was looking for.

Easy to use and battery life is good.  Not bad, but you need a backup, human translator sometimes to check its translations anyway..","positive":1},{"review":"  Takes a while to get used to it, but amazing tech in your hand.  Would work better in a urban setting with stronger signal.  We pre-record selected orders in quiet, then take it to the field to play to non-english speaking workers. A side benefit, our limited spanish has improved too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I volunteer in a thrift shop in a town that is 50-50 English-Spanish speaking.

I wouldn't buy this product again, or a computer from Amazon at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop seems to be a good laptop although it's too early for me to say. However the first laptop I received haad a visible dent on the surface. I am probably going to keep this one because because the scratch is small and I can't be bothered again, but, is amazon knowingly selling defective products as new. Especially this particular laptop that has a very good price.","positive":0},{"review":"  No touchscreen on my model.  I'm not a gamer.  Everything works seamlessly, setup was effortless.  It stays cool, is silent and has met exceeded my expectations so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  A superb gaming laptop, but I actually bought it for engineering grad school. It can run the student version of ANSYS, MATLAB, and will be trying Autodesk software later.One thing I would like to add is that it has a metal exterior(I think the frame is metal in general) with a nice finish. However it does tend to get fingerprints and smudges easily.","positive":1},{"review":"  Before I start my review, I would like to point out that this laptop has a overall review score above 4 stars, and the people who are most likely to leave reviews are the ones who have issues with a product. The only reason I am giving this product a review that is good (I usually only review products if I have something bad to say) is that I feel it is misrepresented by the bad reviews. I would guess that you could probably get 5-6 hours if you are web browsing, and 1-3 hours gaming, depending on how demanding the game is.I will update my review if I have any issues or anything changes.","positive":1},{"review":"  Let me start by saying I have always been an AMD supporter.I was in doubt and buying this i5 based laptop instead of the Ryzen 5 from other manufacturers broke my heart. Make sure you do the same.I bought it during Black Friday and paid 549 USD.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this computer but then they're odd details about it that make you go hmmm. Battery life is GREAT for everyday use that doesn't demand high processing power. give us at least 3.I find it funny that I don't notice any lag during gaming or processing graphic arts rendering and editing videos but I occasionally do when flipping between screens with the Alt+Tab combination, that's just weird.","positive":1},{"review":"  When looking around for new laptops I wanted something that didn't put me in debt but also had decent specs and a name brand graphics card. I eventually settled on this laptop and after 48 hours of use I am very satisfied with its performance. Overall very satisfied with this purchase. I will try to update this review as time goes on.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this open box so it was missing some stuff that you would normally toss anyhow. The performance is pretty good considering how much I paid. Really liked that the computer came without a ton of bloatware installed.battery lasts fairly well while even gaming.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an excellent computer for the price. Everything works as advertised and no issues noticed. Window lovers this is a great deal. Mac guys and gals swallow your pride and irritation duty calls and press on.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros:Keyboard-very silent and comfortableSound-Great clear soundSize-not that big as other 15 inch laptopsPrice-CheapGaming-Greatbrightness sometimes is not that good espacily when there is sun.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been using this machine for a little over two months and I must say this machine delivers excellent performance as advertised. The only thing I don't like about this is the display. I resolved by using the machine as a desktop and hooking up my ultrawide monitor via HDMI best move I ever made. All in all great buy with a few tweaks.","positive":1},{"review":"  The layout of the keyboard is irregular which leads to mistyping at least half the time.  Also, the touchpad is on the left side instead of the middle which causes issues with general usability (ie right clicking when you want to left click, but all the time).  I didn't bother trying to use it much before returning, but the battery did not last as long as I'd expect for a laptop of that size with minimal usage.  Also just a generally unattractive look and giant battery pack, which seems standard with all Lenovo laptops.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got the laptop for a pretty cheap price, and I was so amazed by how they could give you all this great hardware for such a low price.And I realized what was the catch, right after I got them. And your left with almost no games that run consistently without fps drops all the time, and pretty bad performance overall for any use of the cpu. Won't recommend at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  Let's start with the basics. It's a nice looking laptop. The specs are great, but I can't recommend it at that price because the design cuts too many corners on a lot of the peripherals (especially the touchpad). It seems like Amazon is selling them for a little under $700, which I suppose is a much more reasonable price.","positive":0},{"review":"  So far this has been a good budget laptop, but it's early and if that changes I'll change the review. Here's my one major complaint - the touchpad driver that specifically comes on this model does not allow me to turn off reverse scrolling. This is an issue that won't bother 99% of you - most people use the now standard reverse scrolling. But if you're like me, be warned.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop boots up and shuts down quickly, performs multiple tasks simultaneously, and can play games. Not bad overall. I usually use one for my mouse and one for my laptop cooling pad, so I'll have to figure something out there.If the WiFi issue wasn't an issue this would otherwise be a great laptop for the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  The performance was great at first.  I had no issues with this device.  Will continue to use it because I have to, but still, not a good product for what you pay.  Beware.","positive":0},{"review":"  Okay, so you need two--TWO--connections to deliver power to a computer. These are DC devices--positive and negative. If the power connection is this bad, I can't begin to imagine how the rest of the internals are. The entire department, VP on down, should get the axe for this power outlet design alone.","positive":0},{"review":"  after less than two months it's just stuck with black screen and loud vent noise.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've given up trying to get the trackpad to work in a way I like. It seems this model comes with a certain trackpad driver that doesn't allow any customization.This is a pretty small issue, but the Lenovo splash on startup is pretty hideous. I'd imagine there's some way to turn it off in the BIOS, but I haven't bothered looking around.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for the family to use instead of them using my gaming rig. Decent all-around performance. Overall, happy with the machine except for the warranty part, but that could change if this doesn't work. Do your research as this is quite a bit more expensive than when we purchased it and there are most likely better deals for newer tech available going into the holiday season.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this because I was in the need of something new, especially since working from home. My old laptop is about 10 years old and sounds like an engine.  Obviously a lot of care went into it, and that was appreciated.I had photos to add, but can't seem to figure out how to do so.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great laptop awesome from gaming can get over 60 FPS on high settings best laptop for a budget only bummer is it`s only has one ram slot which means no duel channel memory which is fine but could be perfect if they put it in 2020 model. I recommend to undervolt this laptop so you can get more speed and less heat and more battery life I recommend to undervolt to -100v you can undervolt it more but it can be unstable if you looking for a budget gaming laptop this is the best thing I found for the performance.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm not a gamer. Rather, I bought this laptop to use for my Photoshop projects.So, I don't know about its performance in gaming. But, if you're a regular Joe (or Jane), you'll be thrilled.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this laptop to play my childhood blizzard games like Starcraft, Warcraft and Diablo. They handle the remastered and newer ones beautifully on ultra settings. Overall I`m really happy with the buy \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d laptop is also surprisingly very light and quality despite it being plastic. More like the higher tier quality plastic.","positive":1},{"review":"  Item came out of the box damagedwhy me.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Lenovo Ideapad L340 Gaming Laptop with 15.6 Inch FHD display looks amazing.This does not have a CD-ROM so you will have to get an external one.All in all, this is a decent price for a gaming laptop that can handle just about any game.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this laptop for moderate gaming, school work, and occasional video and sound editing. While this laptop is very capable of running most games at 1080p and sweeping the room in terms of school work or general purpose use, video and audio production leaves much to be desired. The only two things that I do not like about this laptop is its track pad and poor battery life. (I use an external mouse and have the laptop plugged in almost all the time anyway, so it's no big deal for me)Overall, this laptop is pretty good for its price and is something that I highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my daughter for doing graphic design   animation and for gaming.  Overall, she's very happy with the system.  It does occasionally lag when loading up software, but runs well once it's ready.  (She also runs multiple, intensive programs at one time, so part of it is her style of use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I actually love this computer. I've been a Macbook guy for 12 years, but money was tight, and I couldn't afford one.Would definitely buy again. No doubt about it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my 10 year old grandson for xmas.  He was thrilled, set it up all by himself even.  He usually stays on 3-4 hours per session.  I did quite a bit of research before purchase and I am quite happy so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  While it worked perfectly well the first day, the next it would not turn on at all. This is apparently a known problem with Lenovo laptops. I am deeply disappointed that I paid almost $700 for a glorified paperweight. Do not purchase if it can be helped.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overall a great mid level gaming machine. I do some coding on it, although I haven't run any benchmarks I have used some crappy image compression scripts and the multi threading module for python on it.**Update**The device does not come with bluetooth capabilities so wireless headphones are out and my device randomly loses connection so I can only assume the wifi card is loose. Overall the performance is decent but there are too many small user experience hiccups.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop is nothing special. track pad works well 90% of the time.My 10 year-old Dell XPS is a much better laptop.Too bad I cannot return it, will probably just give it away.","positive":0},{"review":"  First, I bought this product to use for casual gaming (Blizzard's WOW classic) and looked at the specs and price alone and also saw Lenovo made thinkpad computers too (thinking IBM..Lastly, I do not recommend this product and I do not plan on buying anymore Lenovo products (or from Chinese companies, minimizing Chinese products to the best of my ability, and buy from American companies at a minimum). Lessons learned: do not buy solely on specs, do not buy the cheapest product, if you see anything about cooling problems move on to the next product, research the company, and go to a local professional (ask for recommendations AND non-recommendations).","positive":0},{"review":"  I am not a gamer. I bought this Lenovo because have used Lenovo in past as a business PC and it handled pretty heavy proprietary software demands well. I contacted Lenovo once and were responsive and seemed to want to help. Tech guided me through BIOS update, which did not help.","positive":0},{"review":"  The first couple weeks with the Laptop was great then all of a sudden it died and wouldn`t boot. I received a replacement from Amazon and the replacement unit had a touchpad that was dead on arrival. Now I`m sending this one back and looking elsewhere for a laptop. I cannot recommend this laptop at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  Graphics card in the laptop I received is not the one that was advertised.  It is advertised to have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 and came with a Intel UHD Graphics 630.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not bad for a starter gaming laptop, but I suggest getting something at a higher price point if you intend on ultra settings for AAA gaming. It can handle some lower mid end graphic quality games, but there is a lot of screen tear   FPS drops when running high graphic demanding games.","positive":0},{"review":"  It went from 100% to 16% in less than an hour (58 min.).I realize gaming laptops are not known for great battery life,but please ,58 mins..","positive":0},{"review":"  This was going to be used as a budget gaming laptop to play Overwatch and World of Warcraft. When I got it it was giving blue screens of death and freezing. I contacted Lenovo and they said this computer was not supported (weird since its a Lenovo brand laptop). After all this I just decided to return the laptop and buy a different brand.","positive":0},{"review":"  Solid performing hardware at a very good price.  One thing to note, the \"L340 IdeaPad gaming\" can come in a zillion different configurations.  For the price, this is a great mid-range performance unit that was sub $700 when we purchased it.  This unit has the chops to run side by side with Lenovo's Legion laptops, with the same hardware.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop is overall a great deal, got it on sale for just over $600. I can run any game I throw at it on ultra settings and still get above the built-in display's natuve refresh rate (60hz). The others reviews say in excess of 3 to 5 hours however, even on complete power saving mode, I cannot get above 1 hour and 30 minutes of screen-on time. This isn't too much of an issue for me since I am almost always in a place with power outlets, but it can be an issue for some.","positive":1},{"review":"  Fit my price budget. Definitely able to run games well and on high settings. Compared this to my friend's Acer Nitro 5 and this definitely beats it. You will need a USB C hub if you want to connect your CD's and whatnot.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall its a good laptop.  Been testing it for several months, and overall I like it.Windows 10 blows chunks lately, but I can't blame the laptop for that.Overall I would recommend it to anyone needing a laptop for general business purposes.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0A casi un a\u00f1o de su compra aun sigo encantado con la laptop.Me agrado:-Precio. -solo 2 puertos usb creo que con 3 habr\u00eda quedado mejor ya que a veces si se hecha en falta ese puerto extra, esto para mi es lo que menos me desagrada.En definitiva 100% recomendada, totalmente satisfecho con la compra de esta laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop`s overall design is very nice for a lower priced gaming laptop. It doesn`t have that gaming look that the majority of lower priced gaming laptops have, which was what I was looking for. Lastly, it definitely feels weighted, it is over 4 lbs and you can feel it in your backpack while walking around campus. In my opinion, this is your best choice for a gaming laptop if you can get is for $599 or under.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer is fantastic. I use it for gaming and programming and it generally handles the tasks like a champ. It has a high performance for it's price and it shows. I do not regret the choice I made to buy this computer at all.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far it has performed well. The screen`s anti glare works quite well and the colors are vibrant.5 stars but since I can`t I`ll have to settle for 5 because I don`t think 4 is fair. So long as you`d be willing to purchase a mouse and don`t try to simulate the world, I think whoever purchases this laptop will be satisfied.","positive":1},{"review":"  about a week into ownership and very pleased.  Great price point with large SSD, Nvidia GTX card plenty potent for this old school gamer (single player Half-life, Bioshock, COH, Portal 2).  I like the plastic bottom tray as it's not too cold, and not too hot when on bare legs.  couldn't be happier.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been using this laptop for more than a month now and im in love with it i mainly play rainbow six siege and it runs smoothly on +80 fps when playing on low or medium settings or even high but i prefer the extra fps but i play a bit of csgo some times and its super smooth even on the highest settings and it doesn't get to hot even when playing for all night but a very important note****always play with the laptop plugged in because the games well be unplayable**** other than that its perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice for gaming, it is not touch screen and the battery life well there is no life in the battery.

Although she took good care of the laptop, after just a couple of months it became glitchy and completely unusable.

He has had it for more than a month and has had no issues. Seems to handle all his regular games without issue. I think he has been playing Call of Duty and Counterstrike.","positive":1},{"review":"  Plays everything you can think of at decent settings. Not the monster laptop you might want, but great for college life if you require a lot of memory for software applications, or have multiple projects open. it's good as well as just an overall gaming experience if you can't afford something mainstream like an ASUSROG.","positive":1},{"review":"  The pandemic has forced me to work from home and I have had this laptop for almost a year now.

It logs in from shut down in roughly 25 seconds and is lightning fast in every other aspect. The ONLY thing about it which takes some getting used to is the trackpad. It feels a bit weird, coming from using a MacBook before this.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this laptop for a couple days using it pretty much none stop, and have had no problems so far. The high powered 1650 is a fantastic step up from the 760 in my previous computer, of course not good enough to run ultra graphics on new games but more than good enough to run DOOM Eternal as well as Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order at medium graphics. All ports are on the left side and out of the way(very nice).  Overall Very happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it, battery life is the only potential downside but I mostly use it plugged in so that doesn't really effect my star rating.

My criteria were: not too expensive, but with a good enough processor (Intel i5 and up) and video card (GTX 1050 or up) to run AAA titles comfortably.

I would 100% recommend this laptop for people that need to get things done.","positive":1},{"review":"  You have to edit the registry to get the touch-pad to automatically disable when a mouse is plugged in. I can't tell if it's Windows 10 or the touch-pad software driver which was programmed by incompetent people. That's not a reflection on this product other than that they chose to install win10 on their laptops, an obvious blunder.  I am giving this product 4 stars because the hardware seems to be as advertised, and I am pleased with the laptop with the exception of the above critiques.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a good laptop for gaming for this price.

I`m really please with it. The graphics are amazing, the battery life isn`t the best but it doesn`t bother me much at all.

It's very portable, I enjoy being able to draw on it, the ability to fold it in half is nice. Ultimately it preforms almost as well as expected.

The Wifi is the worst...","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm satisfied with the Chromebook itself, using it daily for hours at a time it does everything that I wanted it for. The screen isn't super sharp FHD or 4K, but it's perfectly serviceable for email and web browsing. In the end, opening the seam led to the zipper pull falling off (as the seam was the only thing holding it on the zipper anymore). The case is, of course, now pretty useless with no way to close it, but at least I managed to get the Chromebook out of it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had purchased this for my tween daughter, and within two days, the trackpad stopped working. I'm put off by Chromebooks in general because I've owned several through the years, and they always seem to have issues, but I got an amazing deal on this one. It was sent back and refunded. I am looking for something else at this point.","positive":0},{"review":"  this product is nice, the touchscreen etc is very nice overall, but mine stopped working not even a moth since I purchased it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Update: I read something about TWO charging ports in someone else's review, and it's true -- there is a 2nd port that can be used if one fails. Happy about that, but wonder how long the 2nd one will hold up. Now I've noticed at least one other review citing this problem. I could kind of deal w  this if I'd used the chromebk for more than 5 months.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received unit with faulty screen, called ACER customer service and they want to mail them unit for repair, I`m not interested to repair my new unit repaired and now I have to pay for return shipping cost, I will never buy again from Amazon 3rd party.

Not happy spending $300 on this.","positive":0},{"review":"  Thing is a pile of junk. Cannot sign into this with a student school account or use Google classroom on the device. Also tried calling customer service and their recommendation was to connect my internet service provider, but only after having me hold the power button for 30 seconds. Dont waste your time with this, get a pc.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for my sons virtual learning experience. He`s in first grade and he can definite navigate between sites really well.

Works great. Disclaimer: do not lose the stylus that comes with it. You will not be able to find the same one again.","positive":1},{"review":"  This chromebook is amazing and the fact it has wacom tech built into the screen is amazing. They make the best quality drawing tablets so get this if you want something good to use with a drawing photo editing app. It's made me accidentally click on things as a result. But the work around is using the pen that's included which I use more anyways.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very easy to use it like using a phone. I would say its just a giant phone.","positive":1},{"review":"  It not compatible with a lot of stuff I need to work on for.","positive":0},{"review":"  the led monitor died for no reason after a month, need to send back to Acer to fix.","positive":0},{"review":"  It does not even download latest zoom.

The old red laptop was just too big and bulky, and between the thermal issues and instability with the OS I was just done with it altogether.  If you're on the fence I can wholeheartedly say (with my name on the line) that this laptop is absolutely worth it.

I swapped thermal paste to conductonaut just to see...","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely love the build, form factor (pretty slim and portable for a gaming laptop), screen (vibrant and responsive), aesthetics (I'm a fan of the blue colour scheme) and performance. The keyboard could do with a little more travel because sometimes I keep typing extra letter unnecessarily but it isn't difficult to get used to.) I noticed a difference of 10-15 frames per secind (my desktop is equipped with a GTX 1080ti and a Ryzen 7 1700) but all the games maxed out still run well above 60 frames per second.Overall the laptop is an excellent buy for the price and even though I had to pay import fees (I'm from South Africa) it was still the best performance laptop I could buy for the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I bought this laptop during the Prime event in July of 2019 for $1000 (usually $1,100-$1,200 around the time before the sell) and its a pretty good value for the hardware even without the sell.

I added a 1tb ssd for storage which is this laptop's only problem imo. Doesn't have RGB which is a plus for me but to each their own.  Can easily get  ~144 fps on games that I play which are Dota 2, WoW, WoW Classic beta, DOOM, and i can get ~50 fps on TWW2 on ultra which isn't too bad.","positive":1},{"review":"  Edit: If you are using ethernet cable for gaming and it's not working properly, go in \"Killer Control Center\" then go in settings and turn off \"Advanced Stream Detect\".Amazing laptop for the price, really good desgin (thermals aswell) and quite compact compared to last year's model. You will get better performance for both gpu & cpu and even ram this way. In my opinion it's the best laptop for the price (I paid $1200 but you can get it for $999 on prime day) if you do photo video editing or gaming high performance demanding work.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I`ve always been a competitive laptop gamer and always want the latest and greatest.

I have a laptop cooling pad with a fan underneath it, and I've even tried changing the thermal paste in the laptop, but none of this was able to offset the high temps completely, although it did help a bit. The thermal paste that was originally in the computer was extremely hard and flaky, and replacing it helped a little, but the computer still suffers from massive temperature regulation issues, making it practically unusable with most games made after 2015.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'll update the score after we send the unit back in for repairs and get it back.From the time we opened the box and got the laptop running, it had semi-frequent blue-screens and forced restarts.It was a great laptop from the limited time I had when it functioned as it should.

My husband could verify, \"I am in love with my laptop\" - that was before I even took it out of the box. This beautiful laptop has only been out of the box for 30 hours and I am so full of regret.

This review is written before I contact Acer about the unresponsive key problem that I have.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this as a replacement for my Alienware 15R3 gaming laptop.  I was expecting a less premium package due to the specs that were being sold at such a low price point, but I was shocked by the quality of this laptop.My only complaint would be towards Amazon who shipped it terribly. putting it in a box without packing paper so it was free to bounce around for the whole trip.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros- plays rift S VR with setting cranked up on most games(I suggest a cooling pad if you VR game though as the temps do throttle performance eventually which is understandable)- plays any regular non VR game worth all settings maxed with no problems at all.- expandable storage and ram and EXTREMELY easy to get to( I had a m.

I have this drawing with bright red hair and it was like all the color she had was leeched out of her and for a gaming laptop the colors should POP and give the games life but considering it can barely handle a drawing I would have to say 3 5 stars.

Be aware that this laptop's screen is not 4K, however it does have a refresh of 144Hz at Full HD in which it makes the graphics look awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  The screen quality and power was good but apart from that I can not reccomend.

Amazon has me paying out of pocket for a new UPS shipping label, when they said they would pay for it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good laptop, good performance, decent thermals. My one complaint would be that the keyboard sucks, its way too sensitive.

It loads Windows in less than 5 seconds. Hopefully it helps keep the temperature lower. The laptop came by default under-volted, which can be checked with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (I recommend backing up settings before using it just in case).","positive":1},{"review":"  the more i use this laptop the more impressed i am.2 slots for ram, max 2x32gb.  unless you dont mind throwing in another grand, then get this with the  RTX 2080 and 4k display.but if you are looking for the best bang for your buck, well you found it here.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros-Great FPS in all games-Great predator sense software (loved adjustable fans and temp monitoring)-Good temps (on max fans. 77-83c average on heavy gaming)-144hz screen is nice (although max setting on most AAA titles only get around 75-85 FPS)-color gamut is accurate-Good build quality-thin, light and not super gamey look-Damn Good price per performance ratio-Storage is easily upgradable(YouTube video)-No problems setting up on my device-Good WiFi card-Fast boot up and read speeds (factory nvme)Cons-Some backlight bleed on pitch black screens (not even noticeable for me anymore)-Not the best battery life (only 4-5 hrs of light work. It still cools very well and runs like new. Best value gaming laptop by far.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had this laptop for about 8 months and it`s doing wonders. I use it for engineering work and also play  games.I would recommend getting this laptop, but At a lower price tag than it actually is. It`s also somewhat heavy, but what can you expect with a gaming laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Really solid gaming laptop my guys. I got it on prime day.Edit 2 06 2020:Still going strong, I ended up replacing the thermal paste on the CPU and GPU, and that definitely helped keeping things 7-10 degrees cooler.Also opted to not use the cooling pad I had, let the laptop circulation (lol) do it`s own thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros: Overall one of the best mid range laptops out right now. The CPU   GPU doesn't break a sweat much and stays fairly cool. The screen is good in pixel density and color spectrum is more than acceptable but there is very, very, very minor LED backlight bleed at the top center of ther screen.I would still purchase this product again.","positive":1},{"review":"  Plays everything I've tried at max settings smoothly.

Any mic you plug into it will sound bad.","positive":0},{"review":"  I absolutely loved this laptop. I used it daily for gaming and school work. With modern warfare, I thought it was because my cpu was overheating, but it was sitting at 80-85 Celsius during a game, so that`s not the issue. I`m not sure if this was just a defect with my specific laptop, but the problem was so persistent that I sent it back and I`m planning on getting a desktop instead of a laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Poor setup experience, home edition is definitely a poor choice. Trying to sync with Microsoft account gives a out of box experience error.","positive":0},{"review":"  First, the positive stuff: I have yet to play a game that this laptop struggles to run. It plays new games on max settings with >60 FPS. I've taken off the bottom panel and cleaned out the fans with air, but the noise persists. The amount of noise that this machine generates has left me with some serious buyer's remorse.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not work when i contacted them they were rude and hung up on ne after telling me it was not there problem i swear it was the worst customer service i have ever had will not buy acer again thank god amazon customer service is good and they helped me bust acer is trash they are bad for you as a customer save yourself the headache and buy something else.","positive":0},{"review":"  The first thing is that my package had been opened.

Just unboxed this and now waiting on a replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love the computer.  A little disappointed that it has a sleep issue that is known to Acer since last year and they have not addressed it.  Laptop will hibernate while in use within minutes of start up   wake up.

Actually, it is its great heat dissipation ability that allows people to make full use of its CPU and GPU. I also like this laptop's keyboard, which feels pretty comfortable. The only deficit of the laptop I bought was that one of the keys' plastic coating was scratched at the corner when it came, but that didn't affect my contentment to the product and I am happy to give it a 5-star.","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely fantastic little rig. Has the horsepower for high frames and good graphics, a monster processor, and a very pleasing form factor. The 144hz makes me despise my work screens when I get in for the day.Would absolutely recommend this laptop if you are looking for something easily portable, attratctive, with the horsepower to run whatever you'd like, all at a price no competitor can match.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great gaming laptop. Reminds me very much of my Alienware R4 (15 inch). It's soft and tactile to allow for a really good feel - much better than MSI GS65 and better than Alienware R4, which was the old school style (also very good) - keys you can hammer on yet don't get loud.Can't go wrong here assuming you don't plan to take the unplugged.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my wife but we're getting divorced so I kept it before I had a chance to tell her. I hate using laptops in general but I guess it will be nice to have if I decide to be a bum again. I added a hybrid drive to increase the disc space. Not sure why now that I won't actually be using it to store much but whatever.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this laptop in late August. It performs great for the price. Incredibly disappointed, but I guess you get what you pay for. I certainly won`t purchase from Acer again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've bought this laptop during Black Friday sales for $928.99($1,176.)Overall, i think the price-performance value of this laptop compensates it's cons. I can recommend it for people on a budget.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this on black Friday for an awesome price and im loving how I can play destiny 2 on high settings at over 155+ FPS. the screen is amazing and it manages temperature really well during gaming.

It has just the power and performance I need for most AAA games on the market. I would 100% recommend this laptop for any gamer at its price.

As a gamer, the performance of speaks to be - the GTX 1660 Ti was well worth the jump from an $800 dollar tier laptop to the $1100 price point.

Was fun while it lasted.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop to play games ( duh ) and use it as my daily laptop for my University work. I searched for a light laptop that can do triple A Games, and the Helios 300 2019 had the best Performance to price ratio by a big margin. It's heavier than I wanted but it's worth the sacrifice for the better performance price ratio.Overall I don't think there's a better Device for the same price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros- awesome designBetter than regular coolingNice graphics card (works for 2k at 144hz)Light up keyboardGreat price16gb ram so you won`t have to upgrade right awayCons- you will have to buy and add day 1 extra memory( so to me you have to add at least $100 ssd to the price)Cooling system works great but system gets hot fast.(recommend cooling pad)Plastic feels cheaply made on some parts**Has Proprietary software for cooling and over clocking. I would recommend not using anything else but what comes with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Definitely a bang for your buck. I see people here making some funny remarks and complains about silly things, but the best part is that actually you can't ever even get a laptop close to this for at least 1300$ (same specs and build quality)Of course, there are certain minor things that could be better, but for this money (I've paid 999$) these are definitely acceptable. We all know the flaws of the IPS screen, so the screen bleed is acceptable if not too much, in my example it is fair good.As a passionate gamer who appreciates 144hz, and can use 101% of this computer, for this money, and +300 400$ there is no better buy or there will ever be most likely.","positive":1},{"review":"  This guy lives up to the hype if you're looking for a very good gaming laptop. Easily I'm able to play Rainbow Six Siege or any other game at 60+ frames even while recording using the integrated Xbox gaming bar recording at 60fps and it's always so buttery smooth. Of course it'll havebto be plugged in about 24 7 if you want it to survive with all that power, and that's not even using the overclocking turbo button, gotta prepare yourself for that airplane jet engine noise as the fans kick into maximum overdrive but at the same time give you the most out of the Gtx 1060Ti inside. I wish I had enough to originally buy the RTX card but really I can see myself using this laptop for another +4 years till it's maybe outdated tech wise.","positive":1},{"review":"  I doubt any laptop is going to perform like this beast does, at the same price. Doom (2016) - 120 fps UltraCS:GO - 280 fps Ultra the list goes on and on with games that will reach 100+ fps. I saved and scraped up money hoping to buy the 2017 version of this same laptop, but the responsibility of fatherhood kept me out of one till now, i almost caved and bought a used gaming laptop from Craigslist, i am so glad i stayed the course and reached the goal. After seeing what this can do over other laptops, i would have been disappointed indeed if i caved and bought a used one.","positive":1},{"review":"  Well it overheats out of the box.. Tried 2 of these. Same issues.","positive":0},{"review":"  Can`t listen to music or watch practically any media without headphones because the speakers are worth probably $5. If you try and game on the laptop your fans are going to spin as fast as physically possible, pushing out a large amount of warm heat right onto your hand. The webcam quality looks like its from a nintendo DSI.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer is absolutely awful. Crashing problems since day 3 and had to do a factory restart after not even 2 weeks of owning the laptop. Gaming is godawful and your CPU will run around a consistent 77 degrees Celsius running LEAGUE OF LEGENDS without any background processes. In short it`s an absolutely terrible product and unless you want buyers remorse and stress anxiety trying to get it sent back stay away from this purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had the laptop for two weeks and it performed very well, but then the display just black screened. I was still getting sound and the keyboard was responding with the lights, but the display wouldn't work.

Ultimately I ended up having to send it back to Acer for repairs and I was without the laptop for another 3 weeks.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great gaming performance for price but screen has a yellow tint to it and the m.2 screws  were so tight they ended up getting stripped when I was trying to remove them so now a got a 100$ ssd sitting around i cant use.","positive":0},{"review":"  Absolutely regret buying this computer. Only 5 months into playing and its failing hardware already. Very disappointed.  I WANT TO RETURN IT NOW FOR FULL REFUND.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop has alot of issues. When I first got it it's battery was dead and I could only use it if it was plugged into the ac adapter I sent it in for repairs which is like 2 week turn around.

This laptop is the worst laptop I've ever received.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unfortunately,  the laptop I received kept blacking out on me (Maybe loose wire for the screen.)

It's such a shame i paid a lot of money for this .","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop performs very well except for that there were 3 dead pixels on day one, and two new ones have developed over the last few months. Very annoying for a device as expensive as this. Also, keeping it looking clean is very hard due to the material used.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop both for gaming and for work. I've had it for a few months now, and I have been very pleased with it for both of these needs.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this laptop. With the specs this laptop has, I think it is the best value for money that you can buy for a gaming laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Not sure how much you want to use my review to order this product.  I'm a 57 year old female that still games but isn't a hardware nerd.  I plug the laptop into a power source so I can't speak to battery life and I don't use the camera so I have no opinion on that.  All-in-all I'd say I got my money's worth and I am happy with this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this as a Christmas present for myself to replace an Alienware that is on its last legs.  It is a great system - boots fast, plays current games fine, has a beautiful screen, not loaded with bloatware, and it is fairly light weight.  It is an exceedingly simple process, so I can only guess that this was a marketing choice to direct more spending at their service centers by the unwary.  That being said, it is still a great PC, and I would recommend it to anyone shopping for a gaming PC in this price range.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have 2 Helios 300: 2017 and 2019. 2019 has better graphics (1660ti vs.Very reliable - 2 year of using by teen for 2017 model has no any damages problems.Really good investment.","positive":1},{"review":"  While I do play older games, I've had no issue with this computer after a month and I've played over 100hrs of online games in that time (I'm loving quarantine). Boots up within 4 seconds.I almost bought a lower end laptop for a few hundred less (~650USD), but am very please I went with this predator as I think it will last me longer (as for as relevancy of the graphics card).  I have not noticed any screen issues mentioned in other reviews, though I have terrible eyes.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm not sure how everyone makes this laptop work without turbo mode. Without turbo mode, I can barely go to 30 fps in an old game like Sleeping Dogs at Extreme settings @ 1080p. Since this is mostly bought for gaming purposes though, just note that initial storage is small. I'll update this in a month or 4 to see if the rating is still the same.","positive":1},{"review":"  One of the best 15\" laptops for gaming I've seen performance and construction wise. Screen is crisp and clear, good CPU and great video card that will last for years. It does not over power the internal speakers but quite noticable.Over all very happy with this laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this computer for gaming + basic usage (MS Office, internet, everyday life programs). For the price it has done an amazing job. Easy, but another cost effortBut overall, if you want to do this for gaming, and are not going to play for super long per session, this performance matches machines that cost double. So the 5 stars is very much factoring the low price.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased on Black Friday but opened XMas day.  It works great and very fast.

If you're looking for a solid value in a gaming laptop that still keeps up with all or most of the games you play, this is it. That said - it is a high-powered laptop, so the battery doesn't last too long, especially while gaming, but I got this for portability, not for running without a charge, so it's no big deal to me.

Also, I strongly suggest getting a micro sd card with plenty of extra memory, the laptop has an adequate built-in SSD, but if you're going to keep any media on it, it would be a good idea to add more.

First, the thing is way wider than your computer or magazine, so it's needs a lot of space on the side of your legs. I just took it out and I couldn't type on the couch with it, and when I put my laptop on it on my coffee table the horrible stand slid across the table as I typed, knocked a glass of soda on the tablr and broke my tv remote.

The description is deceptive, it says \"American cherry\" (but that is the color, not the material it is made of), and \"engineered wood\" (what is that.

I've been looking for a lap desk for months, one that has a lip to hold a laptop, swiveled and of sturdy construction.  Lip also comes off if you aren't looking for that feature.  You can raise and drop the height, and swivel the angles making it a comfortable and easy to use desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  It arrived in a day. My box didn't have the colored sticker but I didn't mind. Maybe a screw is a little loose in the design. Even though it wobbled slightly, it was basically still reliably sturdy so I still rounded up to five stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the lower version of this laptop desk.  I was waiting for it to be released because I tried the original version and it couldn't be adjusted low enough to be used on a chair comfortably.  Also, you have to balance tilt with the weight of your laptop (my laptop is heavy due to some components in it) so it doesn't fall off the couch depending on how you are using it.  It'll work, for now.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this cautiously, but after using it for less than twenty minutes..I'd recommend this to anyone, especially for other college students who don't have enough space for a traditional desk, or don't want to be uncomfortable during long study sessions.

Unfortunately, the shortest length of the legs are too tall for comfortable use on a couch.

At the maximum height adjustment, there is no using this product because of how cheap and flimsy it feels.

It's really not sturdy at all.

Any convertible standing desk option was way more money than I wanted to spend, so I have up.

Thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  As soon a I opened this table and set it to the lowest height, I instantly loved it. Took just 10 seconds to open the legs and lower raise them.

I wish it was a little more solid but overall this is a completely affordable and useful alternative to an actual standing desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  The product seems well made and for most people I am sure the product is fine.  I have two complaints that have kept me from using it as I hoped to.

I bought it for my husband, who's fit and not very wide girth. There's a reason, I guess, they show a child in the photo of the lapdesk being used on the floor -- an adult's legs barely fit width-wise and it meant my husband couldn't move his legs at all while trying out the desk. We wanted to like it, but sent it back.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted it specifically to use on my sofa. It was shown in a video and in the name description for such use, but my \"normal\" sofa was not \"deep\" enough unless I took the back cushion off.

But the second one last over a year and broke again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Few problems with this, the most important one is that you cannot adjust it lower than 9\" 1 2 which is annoying because if you want to lay down some you simply cannot unless you tilt the top tray. Well if you adjust the top tray by tilting it, you're unable to use a mouse.The leg adjustment clips do not hold well.","positive":0},{"review":"  too big to span your lap for a laptop....","positive":0},{"review":"  I reached out to the manufacturers within 15 days of buying the product saying that the table is wobbly. I was using the product for placing my Surface Book and watching movies. Now the part used to adjust the angle came off along with the spring beneath. I decided to send the product back to Amazon now, I am losing 10$ now as Amazon said that they would refund only $20.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use this to create somewhat of a standup desk.  The size is fine and my MacBook Pro 15\" 2017 fits perfectly well with room all around for arms or a mug or something.  Since it is so little money to purchase, I still think it is worth it to buy it, but the product is cheaply made.  I guess you get what you pay for.","positive":0},{"review":"  My issue that while you can set the height, if the legs get snag on anything the height lock does not hold.For example, I was using the table while sitting in recliner.  I went to get up and one of legs got caught in the arm of the chair. That leg was pulled to full height.","positive":0},{"review":"  The piece of plastic that keeps your laptop from sliding off broke  and super glue isn't helping. It was good until then because its lightweight and easy to customize. As  larger person, I also wish it had longer legs because I can't fit underneath it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was disappointed with the desk. Basically the desk is not stable when used on the bed. Keying info on the computer causes the desk to be unstsble.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product arrived as stated. It looks like in the picture and is pretty decent. And it does the job as it's supposed to. I'm happy with it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop table is just what I was looking for. Total time taking it out of the box to using it: 10 minutes approx. As I write this, I am keyboarding in comfort right here on my sofa. I am truly happy with my choice.","positive":1},{"review":"  This lap desk has been such a great purchase.. I have wide hips, and this desk fits me well..","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm really pleased that I chose this laptop bed table. I don't think there was a better option out there. It doesn't make it unusable, and it doesn't seem to get worse either. But the extra space and a little extra bracing would be well worth a little more money and a little more weight to me.","positive":1},{"review":"  After working from home for a few years, always sitting at my desk, i sometimes uses this laptop holder that would just plop on your lap. I then got a puppy (7 month year old rescue named Sunny from Puerto Rico...","positive":1},{"review":"  My primary use case for this product is from a seated position. (For reference I'm 6ft & 200lb.) but even the lowest setting seems a little tall. Fortunately, support got in touch with me and it sounds like they have a solution for that coming up.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have neck issues and needed to be able to read, use my phone, tablet etc. without having to bend my neck downward.  The legs have padding on the bottom of them so they won't tear up your couch material. There is plenty of leg room (width and height), but I was careful to measure my leg width and the couch cushion width.","positive":1},{"review":"  I absolutely love this lap desk, and highly recommend it. I was skeptical at first because I`m used to working at a desk with 2 additional monitors, and a keyboard but this is perfect. It could get a little wonky, if not.I also tried this while sitting on the couch and floor, and enjoyed those experiences as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was a little concerned from reading the reviews, but I did my research and decided to try this particular desk.  I am so glad that I did.  The gray raised bumpers at the bottom (lower edge) of the desk are detachable, which is excellent.  The bumpers got in my way, so the removal of these items make this desk much more flexible.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this as a lap desk for my work computer. The legs are sturdy, the adjustable height setting clicks are solid. To be fair, I lost the rubber foot so it`s my fault. I`d buy this again without hesitation.","positive":1},{"review":"  My 10-yo son was wanting something that he could use as a desktop surface while in his bed. I had originally bought the taller version, which was great. I can confidently leave my laptop on the surface and walk away from it with no fear that a joint is going to let out or that my laptop will slide off the top. Very sturdy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros: sturdy table top, leg stability, ability to angle the table, height adjustment, and the perfect width for our recliner.Cons: flat surface with no venting (laptop overheats quickly,) laptop area is completely to the left and cannot be adjusted (bumpers for laptop and mouse are different heights.)This item is excellent as a table but a bit awkward as a laptop desk for our use.","positive":0},{"review":"  it's a great idea and very useful. but for the price, holy crap is it dinky. but for $50, I expected a much more solid piece. Most likely going back.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked well for almost a year. But then it broke when I sat my laptop on it. Poor quality 2 stars because it did last some time. I just expect anything I'm paying for to last at least a year.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop desk works but we found it unstable. The mouse kept sliding off the mouse pad as it was hard to balance. We had to keep doing a juggling act. We needed up just putting laptop on our laps & using the mouse pad on a nearby end table.","positive":0},{"review":"  This table is okay.  It's the kind of quality you would expect from the photos.  I measured it out before purchase but it was hard to tell how it was going to be in person.  I have to return this, unfortunately.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use it on my desk for a makeshift standing desk. The height adjustment is not super convenient, so I just keep it locked to my preferred setting and take it off my desk when I want to sit...","positive":0},{"review":"  Tried to use my laptop on top of it but it turns out I literally CANNOT type anything because it is too wobbly. It will hurt your eyes badly. I think that's why people gave high score.  But the advertising picture has a laptop on top of it so it is misleading.","positive":0},{"review":"  Leg's do not lock down and the table surface slides down. Very wobbly.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product was sturdy and well-built, however, the lowest setting is too tall for a shorter person when sitting and using it as a lap desk.  I am 5'3\" and it was not ergonomic for me at all, so I sent it back to get a desk that actually sat on the lap.  The desk was plenty big to hold my 15\" laptop and a mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  The height of it was too short for what I expected.  It was also built very cheaply, and was returned for full refund.It was also set up for a right handed mouse user, and I was left handed.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a pretty good laptop desk. It does what I need, which is to support my laptop above my lap and keep it stable. I luckily had a gift card I used for half of it but I think $40 is too much for something like this. But for the $20 I paid, I think it's very much worth it as it's functional and does its job well.","positive":1},{"review":"  Much sturdier than it looks in the pictures. Height and tilt lock firmly in place. This little desk has helped my neck pain (Now that my laptop is much closer to eye level) as well as shoulders (no longer hunched over the laptop).Only downside: this model doesn`t have a bumper to prevent a mouse from sliding off when tilted.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sorry not sure how to put photos here.  I like this table, I now have one for my Lazy Boy Recliner, and also one in my bedroom, for when my body decides it's time to shut down, I wanted this because I like to write down Characters in books I read.  and at the top, I can secure with velcro, a small pen holder.  I've looked for the perfect bed table, and so far this one is my favorite.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a nice sturdy laptop table.  The table top adjusts to level and slanted, and the legs adjust higher to lower.  I'm sure with some ingenuity, I could modify it somehow to go lower, but I have not tried as of yet.  But I really like the table, and think it is very well made.","positive":1},{"review":"  I researched and researched to find this desk.  But half the time when I put in that much effort, I feel like an idiot for buying something online that I would have rejected if I`d seen in with my own eyes in the store. I took a picture of what one of the gray tabs look like in the locked position, and then in the unlocked position maybe that will help someone. Oh another tip- I bought this along with the following little cordless clip-on light: Hapurs LED Desk Lamp, 2 in 1 (Stand on Own & Clip Everywhere) Gooseneck Tube Touch Sensitive LED USB Portable Rechargeable Dimmable Portable Lightweight Table Reading Study Clip Lamp LightI am so so so pleased with this little desk and light- for about 50 bucks I now have my little portable office, and with my iPad weighs maybe 5 pounds.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this to use with my iPad when I`m working on it for long stretches. It does exactly what I needed: relieves neck tension, avoids hand cramps, allows for tablet rotation with better support than the case easel provides. I could not ask for a single feature that this table desk does not have. It`s literally a perfect tool, and I use it far more than I expected to.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love everything about the lap desk. It is highly adjustable and built of sturdy components.My sister asked for the Amazon link to purchase one for my niece. I can`t remember whether I submitted an earlier review, but given its impressive ease of use and durability, this seems a good time to submit a two year review of the product.","positive":1},{"review":"  What I like about this lap table is that it's sturdy, there is enough leg room to not feel cramped, and it's really light weight without being flimsy.Some reviews indicated it could tip over as the \"feet\" extend to the edge of the sofa, well, just be careful that's all. I've used it with my laptop for work daily since I got it and I LOVE it..","positive":1},{"review":"  Credit where credit is due. This is arguably my best Amazon purchase all year.In any event, very happy with this product. Thank you.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's 9.8\" high, too small for a standing desk unless you are very short.  I'm using the Avantree with my rain design mStand, and the combo makes a great, easily convertible standing desk.  Very pleased with their exemplar customer service.","positive":1},{"review":"  had to send it back, it was just too tall.  I would of been great if I could of shortened the legs somemore.","positive":0},{"review":"  This tray is awful and uncomfortable. It tilts very awkwardly and my legs can barely fit under it when I need it. There's almost no room for your mouse of accessories. They then pretended to care about my concerns just to get a review change so now I reiterate my message.","positive":0},{"review":"  Of course there is leg room , and it is foldable. They should have focused on the main thing which is the quality and the height. They should have done it an inch or two lower. If it is place at the highest you will look like you will be riding those ridiculous high motors bike  handles.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased my first unit for our family room and received my unit on 02 27 2020. I wanted to purchase a second unit for my bedroom and tried to reorder, much to my surprise, the company increased the price from $44.I will add, I like the unit, but I will not purchase one from this manufacturer. Even if I pay more, someone else will get my business.","positive":0},{"review":"  Table rotated just as easily in the locked position as in the unlocked position and is so lightweight that a large laptop makes it top-heavy and unstable. While at first the dedicated area for the mouse seemed like a good idea, the drastically off-center position is a bit annoying if you are watching TV in bed. Item would have been more attractive without the Avantree logo (unremovable) over the woodgrain.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just got this, it does the job.  Wobbly Wobbly, though  I still think I will keep it.","positive":0},{"review":"  it's so slick....","positive":0},{"review":"  decent product, works well for what it was designed for. The hand support and laptop edge dont even come close to fitting. The filler caps that are provided if you chose not to use these 2 features, didnt even fit the holes. Quality is low to mid range.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's much lighter than expected.  If used on a bed, as I use it, be careful when placing a laptop or anything fairly heavy on it, as it will be top-heavy, with a tendency to tip over.","positive":0},{"review":"  I used my tray a lot - mostly sitting on the couch.  I'm really sad the leg broke off.","positive":0},{"review":"  This table is really good, much better than I expected.  The construction quality, the packaging, even the price, as it's not as expensive for what it provides.Here you can see my laptop with plenty of space to both sides for a cellphone and a wallet to each side (see small toy for reference of available space).The only con, is that I thought I could work with the table from my sofa, but given my size, the table is a little bit larger so not really comfortable in that case.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this table. It is very versatile. I use a mouse and you need to have a mouse pad for the mouse to work as it should.It well built very sturdy to use why sitting in bed.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does everything I needed. I can sit on the couch and work on my computer without contorting my body in a way that makes my body ache. I will keep it, but it is ugly. Good thing I can easily fold it up and hide it under the couch when I'm not using it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s perfect for me. I use it on the couch for eating.  Folds up easily. Really a great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Let me start by saying that this is the most I have ever payed for a computer laptable. I read all the reviews and and weighed all of my uses. The table portion has a great border around the table that is very durable and the ledge that holds the computer in place is taller than most and my computer has never slipped since I have boughten this one. I'm very impressed with this lap table and know I well have it for a long time and highly recommend it to anyone.","positive":1},{"review":"  It might be too early to write a review since this arrived last night.  I work hours on my laptop and didn't like it sitting on my lap.  The bar on the bottom keeps my laptop secure and it does not move around.  I haven't tried to extend the legs but I like the option.","positive":1},{"review":"  Finally the lap desk I've been looking for.  I do a lot of art coloring as well as computer work.  This is fine, but I like to change positions if I'm sitting for very long and would appreciate the legs going out just a little wider.  I'm hoping the larger size might give me more versatility there too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this thing. It seems a little cheesy at first, but then when you're using it, you realize how sturdy it is, and stable. The non-skid feet on my laptop keyboard keep it from sliding.I would say if you're looking for a versatile table for your laptop, keyboard, study, crafts, puzzles, or any purpose, this is a great choice.","positive":1},{"review":"  I looked all over Amazon for a simple, but practical Laptop Lap Table that was adjustable. I read the reviews on this one and decided to purchase it. Overall, it is serving my purpose and keeps the laptop off of my lap--even the lightest laptop gets hot or heavy after a long period of use. With the Laptop Table, you can go for hours in comfort.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wanted an adjustable \"lap desk\" or table that swiveled so that I could read and or do crossword or Sudoku puzzles.  I got tired of doing them in my lap and hurting my neck.  This is a well made table, everything is adjustable and you can fit it to your needs.  Very highly recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  One of the legs cracked after a few months (see image). Not happy with this product.On the positive end, the finish on the materials held up over time. I can see this desk useful for elevating light object, but nothing more.","positive":0},{"review":"  The top section where to keep the laptop is not sturdiness..very uncomfortable when you resist your hand on work..","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is sub par and customer service is non existent. I would definitely purchase a different brand to save yourself time and trouble.","positive":0},{"review":"  Will work handsomely on a solid or semi-solid surface but is somewhat top heavy. Not goodfor the couch potato.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very frustrating and disappointing. Looks nice, seems sturdy HOWEVER it doesn`t really adjust it only moves between two different options and neither is fitting for my height.","positive":0},{"review":"  My only complaint is that it doesn't go low enough when I'm sitting in my bed.  It may be because I have a foam mattress so i kind of sink into it.  That's what I wanted to replace.  I'm still testing it out and I'm on the fence about returning it at the moment.","positive":0},{"review":"  it serves the purpose and so far seems pretty sturdy. Updated: it is still sturdy but left it back in Maryland. One of the legs was easily damaged in as far as it crushed too easy even though I had it completely covered and packed. Yes it still stands and does not wobble when used sitting on a bed but disappointing with the damage.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the product. I like the adjustable height. I purchased it to use to make jewelry and there has been a few times that the table top has easily inclined. There go the beads .","positive":0},{"review":"  I was disappointed with how wobbly this is when using it as a standing desk.  I feel like it wouldn't be that hard to make a sturdier product. I don't care about the tilt, so I would prefer a sturdy, non-tilting stand.  However, since I'm only using it for short periods of time to keep me from sitting all day, it's okay.","positive":0},{"review":"  The height isn't comfortable for use in bed, and the tilt is not as adjustable as I hoped. Not pleased with this purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  I just received the product today. So far it's fantastic. Only have it one day so far but as of right now it seems, very sturdy, very comfortable to use, and does exactly what it's supposed to. Great purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love it. I wasn't sure what I would be getting for $30 and order it online, but man this thing is great and I will be ordering another one for my wife and kids.

In loving memories Debbie K.","positive":1},{"review":"  Came well packaged in a nice carrying box - good for packing if moving. Just received this so haven`t used a lot.

So far I am very pleased.","positive":1},{"review":"  just WOW, this is great. i like to put my laptop on my bed at night to surf the web and watch tv but my laptop gets hot and i do not like the positioning i have to keep doing to keep it right. This table solves all my issues and it is stable, does not fall over and looks great.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very lightweight.  I thought it was going to break but it hasn't. I write often and have back problems so I was looking for something like this to help me write in bed or on the couch etc. long story short I'm very satisfied.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just received it, and tried it on the bed with laptop. I just set it one angle down from being straight.I got this because I just got surgery and in \"kinda\" bed rest, so it's super convenient for its purpose, to be able to work from bed. It would be convenient to be able to \"store\" the stopper on it, as I may need to use it at a higher inclination, but then I would need to look for it and now store the two hole covers.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this portable tray so that I could work on my laptop in bed and recliner as I was recovering from surgery.

I use it daily and enjoy it the more I use it. Thanks for a great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  As with many people, a month ago I started my remote aka work from home career.  I had an extremely portable lap desk that sat on my lap with a part that came out for my mouse.  Also I have had a difficult time in the past finding a desk that allows me to comfortably put it across my legs lap - this one is the perfect width.  I am very happy with this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a lifesaver for me. I suffer from ME and Fibromyalgia and this table allows me to prop my computer and phone up without having to hold it on my legs. Have not figured out how to solve that issue yet.

It's unsturdy and prone to moving side to side, and the mechanism to move it up and down often malfunctions. I don't know if I just got a faulty one but I'm extremely disappointed, as this was quite expensive.","positive":0},{"review":"  For this price this looks very cheap and the legs shake left and right as if it is 10 year old used product.And it doesnt even tilt 30% up and down easily.Utter waste of time and money..","positive":0},{"review":"  A shiny, thin metal molding runs all around the edge of the wooden table top. The edges are very uncomfortable if you happen to rest your elbows on them. Poor design for an item you rest your forearms on while typing. No hassle return policy.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use this little table around the house to hold my laptop when I'm on the couch or bed several times a week.  It's great that it can be tilted to different angles.  From a value standpoint, it's a little pricey.  I found the exact same table (but in a different color) for considerably less money about 2 weeks after I received this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was just too bulky for my needs. Not easy or quick to adjust and takes up way too much space on my desk. I`d return it if I could so it`s a plant stand now.","positive":0},{"review":"  Overal it is ok but very hard to use it on a regular coach or anywhere that you would be sitting. It would flip over. Wish It could be more fitted on a regular chair or coach. I mainly got it for that.","positive":0},{"review":"  The lack is mine. I should have measured my crossed leg lap spread before buying, but this is a desk for a small child not an adult.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was looking for a solution for a tablet with a easel style base and fold out key board. This table isn't really big enough to support the keyboard and the tablet's easel. It is a nice design and nice material. Just not big enough to function properly.","positive":0},{"review":"  The housing that connects one of the legs to its floor brace has split in two. It is a lot of money to pay for something that breaks in 6 months.","positive":0},{"review":"  The leg extension lock has failed while engaged twice now in 2 days, leading to a laptop tumbling to the ground.  Not impressed for the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  This desk meets all of my expectations. It fits on every chair I need it to, the legs can be adjusted independently of one another, so if one sinks into the chair more, I just raise it up a little higher so the table is still level. Sometimes, the leg raising things that hold it slip a little bit, but so far that hasn`t been a major issue. It`s not as sturdy as a regular desk of course, but has done very well for this time of working from home during a pandemic.","positive":1},{"review":"  Avantree's Laptop Table is one of the best home-office purchases I've made. I initially bought this for myself, because I'm almost always using my laptop sitting in my lap or on top of my bed blankets.It's really a worthwhile purchase if you use your laptop around the house, and especially on top of your bed. It'll most likely add years to your laptop's life by preventing hours of unnecessary internal heat.","positive":1},{"review":"  Needed an upgrade from an different model. Works great I use this for my 17. I have enough room. Great build and quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  A great lap desk that delivers on its promised features. My only complaint is that the surface of it is a little slick, but that's certainly not a deal-breaker. I've owned several lap desks and this is by far my favorite.","positive":1},{"review":"  Due to the nature of my home situation, I end up working on my computer while laying in bed, while using the big screen TV on the wall as my monitor (big screen TV's make great monitors, btw .).  If the forward facing feet were a few inches longer, this problem would be solved.  Still a great product though, worthy of five stars with the feet modification.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently attended a seminar that introduced the benefits of standing (or better said, the dangers of sitting a lot) and came away with a commitment to find an option.

Its sturdy, and its height adjustment feature is fantastic.3 in MSI GP72 gaming laptop, with room for a mouse on the side.

Great if you like breakfast in bed also.","positive":1},{"review":"  One word - flimsy. I really love the idea and everything. So I wouldn`t get it if I were you. According to the photos and reviews, thought it would be good but I regret buying it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The legs do not lock in position well.  There is no lock to prevent the legs from collapsing. The unit does not lay flat when the legs are folded over.This unit needs re-engineering.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's OK. It works well for me using my laptop while sitting in bed, which is what I brought it for.  Again, it's just OK.  If it was about $20 I would have given it a higher rating.","positive":0},{"review":"  The table is well made, but I found that the adjustment didn't go low enough. I'm not overweight, so the height range is probably perfect for some people. I preferred one of those fully adjustable Z leg models that could get my laptop positioned and balanced perfectly.","positive":0},{"review":"  This desk is so cute. I thought it would be taller tho.

My husband uses it as a TV tray.","positive":0},{"review":"  Exactly what i needed. I work from home time to time and since my job is computer related (sitting for over 9 hours a day) and at work we have adjustable desks (we can stand or sit as we feel needed), sitting all day when working from home was giving me a lot of pain in the lower back area. Very good, useful product. Thank you.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a BIG girl, so I was a little worried that it might not fit over my lap. It fits just fine. They were a gem to work with.

Good: I use it in bed, on the couch, where ever and it works because it's highly customizable. The tilt is controlled by grooves, sometimes you can't get the angle you want. You can't change the tilt and height at the same time at all, so there's a lot of trial and error.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an excellent lil fold up desk.

All in all very impressive.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a quick purchase without much thought as I needed an adjustable stand for my lap top so I can work standing up during the lock down.The design is very old fashioned reminding me of a food tray like those used at hospital bed.

It is, however, a very well made lap desk.  Very, very easy to use.  Unfortunately for me, just too tall.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you're intending on using this as a standing desk, get something bigger and higher quality.

You can get the same thing for a tenth of the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use this on top of a table in order to elevate my coloring books while I color.  It helps the fatigue that results from hunching over a table to color.  It's better than hunching over though, so I just deal with that.

She uses it to read, draw, and use her laptop in bed and also stand at her drafting table and use it as a quick and easy tilt option to angling the whole table while she draws, paints or animates.  The plastic snap-in lip that holds a laptop or book is rather shallow but the holes allow you to add your own dowels and create a thicker and stronger support if you like, and it's also handy to be able to remove it use the solid surface without it.  I'm glad my daughter found this.","positive":1},{"review":"  There were no issues with height adjustment to my 5'11 stature or my gaming and snack needs.

My desk at home is too small to accommodate most of the set ups to work standing up and this does the job perfectly. It`s light and easy to store away under my desk when not in use. I also have used it on the bed and it works great for crocheting or knitting as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sturdy, but not heavy, so it met my requirements for using in my lounge chair.

Plus, my lap is no longer feeling the heat from the computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have purchased many stands (I have 8 kids and they are not gentle with these) most stands break in a few weeks or are flimsy pieces of junk.

Also because of the \"misalignment\" between the mouse support and the computer support, laptops cannot be centered should that be required. A slight adjustment in, and addition of, some more holes can fix all these issues.","positive":0},{"review":"  Durable table but it sits a little too high for me, wish i could lower it more.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a good sized table but not well made.  The legs adjust without touching the latches so I keep having to put them back where I want them.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did a lot of research before I chose and made the right decision. This is the neatest little table for a million uses. I even liked the box it came in. Very cool.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like the table, and how easy it is to adjust and fold the legs.  My issue - I wish it could go a bit lower.  It's slightly too high, which makes it an issue with my wrists while typing.

This desk fits the bill completely.Another great thing is that the height is adjustable AND you can even adjust it to sit at an angle which is pretty handy too. Great desk and would definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This table is amazing.  I am a plus sized person and it is so nice to be able to sit under the table comfortably.  This table is very sturdy and the tilt works easily, with a snapping lock that makes me feel confident it won't shift.  I have even used it on my dining table to bring my laptop higher so I can use it standing when my back aches.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love my new lap table.

The thing I got was smaller, only had one, and looks feels like cheap plastic. Think twice before purchasing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Would have returned it had that been an option. Color is truly terrible - kind of a yellow  green fake wood look. Also, too high at lowest point, which was my fault for not reading the description closely.","positive":0},{"review":"  Don`t expect the desk to be stable if you want to do a lot of typing on the computer.

They work great but it would be better to have something already attached (or attachable) to the table.Great product so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great of recliner chair. Seems 3 4\" to 1\" too tall at the low position.

Easy to use.  Easy to clean.  Would buy it, again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this table to hold my ProBook when I sit in \"my chair\".

I'm thinking of getting another one to keep at work.","positive":1},{"review":"  I originally had some difficulty adjusting the laptop table I ordered but was contacted my Avantree's customer service team and they immediately resolved the issues. The table I received is the perfect height for sitting at my desk (at the lowest level) or standing (on the highest setting) there are also various angels and highs I can use if I am working in bed or on the couch etc. I don't even have a separate keyboard but haven't noticed any problems with typing at the elevated level.

Now that I have it I think that it cost a bit much.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's an okay laptop table.  The top could use something to keep the laptop from sliding around.  It would be a better design if the lip at the bottom went all the way across to keep wireless mouse from sliding off.  It adjusts fine and collapses for easy storage.","positive":0},{"review":"  Saw Acer released a 10th gen CPU laptop when I was looking at their product list to replace one given away at the same price point, and liked the specs, especially the wireless. So far it's worked without a hitch, though I did strip out the bloat and get a custom color profile for the screen.Only cons are that I'm not a big fan of 4GB of the ram being soldered in permanently (though being a slim model I get get why,) and I don't think Acer enabled Adaptix power management on this so you're stuck at 15w for the CPU. If I find out they did, I'll change that part.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this laptop for a few days and so far everything has worked well. The screen resolution is crisp and amazing quality when playing 4k videos on YouTube or just general browsing on the internet. So far, this Acer laptop has blown the Lenovo laptop away in regards to speed, screen resolution (both being Full HD screens) and being able to quickly render 1080p and 4k video along with having no issues watching 4k videos on YouTube.So far, I recommend this laptop for anyone who is looking to replace an old laptop or just wants to have another one around the house.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop is great. I have no problem with its function, its look, its size, weight or battery life. There is nothing except these two tiny little bars that don't stick out at all beyond the lower ledge, so there is nothing to 'hook' to so you can open it. I'm not sure how other laptops differ from this (I've only had maybe 5 or 6), but I've never had one so hard to open.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've only had this laptop for about a week now but I love it.

But I use my laptop predominately for office applications, so email, Microsoft Office apps, web browsing, mapping running routes online. For these tasks, it is jaw-droppingly fast: It has exceeded my expectations, and at roughly $700 after tax, I feel comfortable recommending this computer in this configuration, which includes the 500-gig SSD, to anyone who needs productivity in really attractive package that feels like it'll last.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had an HP laptop that I had used for about 6 years.  It was accidentally dropped by a family member and was too costly to repair.  It came in a timely manner and I has proven to be a good buy.

So far very pleased.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just received it today. Packaging could be better as the HDD upgrade kit inside is all bend.. I don't understand this design (there are 2 bars that sticks out on TOP of the cover).","positive":1},{"review":"  The product details comparing to others says that the processor speed is 4.2 GHZ but it is actually 1 GHZ as reported by Windows. This means, you can't have a display at this port as you would expect. Thirdly, it plays Destiny 2 at 15 fps, which means it can't actually play this game with the given low mid-end NVIDIA card.","positive":0},{"review":"  If I wanted a $650 brick, I would have bought one.

It is also difficult to open, there is no not a notch for this and it opens hard. Maybe the laptop was damaged during transportation or it's a manufacturing defects.Given that the goods were purchased new and cost not 300 dollars, but more than twice, I believe that the laptop is not worth the money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Horrible laptop.  Lasted a few weeks, then began shutting down and not restarting, freezing up, screen going black.  The only help I am offered is sending my business computer in for about a month to be 'repaired'.

It has so many functions that can be useful during an emergency like the one we had a few years ago when all power for 30 miles around was off for over a week.  the dual charging of solar and crank make short work of recharging (I tried it out to make sure but I keep it charged with good old USB.  This is an easy 5 Stars rating for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am only writing this because the asked for a review because they are a \"small company\". If I truly rated it, for my expectations, I would give it a 3 5-3. I just want to see what the company does in response to my review to see if they are a good company. Not really mad at the product, just dissatisfied with the green concept and charging aspects as a tree hugger.","positive":1},{"review":"  The design has a large battery capacity, strong lighting functions including lighting mode and motion sensor.

It has options and uses...","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a must have item.  It has an excellent sounding radio with great reception.  It is very well made, the shipping was very fast, and the price was very reasonable.  I am happy I bought it and I will certainly be using it the next time the power goes out.","positive":1},{"review":"  I originally bought this product to simply store in case of an emergency power outage. Then we realized it was GREAT to use while out on a \"no access to an electrical wall outlet\" day (setting upvolunteering for civic events, hiking trails, weddings receptions)--pretty much anywhere that either an outlet is not present or it's unacceptable bad taste to plug into one while at an event. I have been so pleased with this unit, that I have bought 5 more (2 for adult-children's homes family, 1 for uncle in wildfire zone prone to electrical shut downs, and 2 for homeless gals so they don't have to scratch to find a place open willing to allow them to charge). Superb.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this for emergency purposes. I like to test everything out before stowing it for its intended use. It might be a matter of life and death.  Hold these companies responsible for their advertising.","positive":0},{"review":"  Poorly made and was not able to pick up any of the weather band stations during Hurriane Hannah.  It only picked up one FM station (and was poor sound quality) - don't waste your money.","positive":0},{"review":"  We had a bad storm this week, the power was out for 8 hours I thought it was the perfect time to make use of this  Emergency-Hand-Crank-Radio. Sadly it did not work at all, I have an iphone XR and my sister have samsung. We kept receiving the popup says the accessory was not compatible with the phone. I would give this 0 star if I could.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased 8 units as gifts to give away to members of my search and rescue team. I like the light options, they are bright and operate well, especially the motion light when your bed down for the night. The Weather band frequencies which are voice come in clear, the FM frequencies are music and come in mono of course but okay,, but the AM band does not work at all on any of the 8 units. This was a little disappointing because AM could be a source of local news updates in your area during a crises.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had a power outage for 24hrs after getting this. I purchased mostly to recharge my iPhone. The solar cell did not recharge the device after a day of sunshine. Do not bother buying unless you just want a flashlight and radio.","positive":0},{"review":"  There are some pros and cons to this radio, as too many things.  Pros:  The color is bright and very visible (mine is green).  The radio doesn't pick up any stations very well in the building - which, if we're honest, is where we would be during emergencies.Overall, for the money, I guess an ok emergency radio but certainly could be better.","positive":0},{"review":"  The lights, and radio work great. Sound isn't bad at all.I have not used the solar power feature to charge it yet but typically devices like this don't have good solar power.Thenhand crank would be good in an emergency if you need light or radio but nothing else.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was never fully able to get the device to charge past 75%.  using both the solar panel and hand crank.  going to return it and get something else.  I have had it less than 2 weeks.","positive":0},{"review":"  I liked the size but I feel the quality of materials used like for the example the plastic covering could've been thicker to help it last longer or have rubber corners to help protect against dropping.","positive":0},{"review":"  Tuner is useless.  When you flip up the \"solar panel\" it automatically turns on a light, draining the solar charge as it charges.  Move on.  Avoid any \"promoted\" products on this site.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this as an emergency back up. Fortunately I have not needed it for that purpose.I did not expect a high end emergency radio, but it's not bad. I think that the price could be reduced by $7-$10, but I'm not disappointed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I took delivery of this emergency radio the other day, I'm quite impressed how well it's designed and constructed. It looks like what is advertised, and it arrived super quick. Overall, I'm very pleased and would recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  When Hurricane Florence came into SE North Carolina we lost all power and for a couple days couldn't even fire up the generators. During that period that little hand cranked radio was our lifeline to NOAA weather, local radio reports, keeping our phones charged in hopes of returning cell service and light during the scary screaming winds at night. I must have turned that crank a million times, but it never failed us, and when it was all over it went right into the emergency supplies to be ready for the next one.","positive":1},{"review":"  After 2 weeks i don't have much to say. It's small, sound is good, has all the needs for an emergency loss of power situation. I like the fact that it's able to recharge  my Android phone.

The flashlight is very bright and the SOS alarms is loud and clear.","positive":1},{"review":"  Received this yesterday afternoon and had to use it by 8:30 pm last night for our historic early October ice storm.  Its a great emergency radio and much more.Didn't intend to use this radio within hours of receiving it but it sure is handy to have in a power outage from an ice storm.  I'd say its Oklahoma weather approved.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is fairly well made. The lights are bright and the radio works surprisingly well. But in all honesty if an emergency occurs it still will be a useful tool. Just make sure to charge it completely beforehand.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for preparedness against a storm knocking out the electricity. Arrived partially charged (yay) and easily charged via  USB connected to an outlet. Tested the lights, nice bright LEDs. I hope I never have to use it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's got all the bells-and-whistles one needs in an emergency radio: several ways to power it up, AM FM NOAA bands, lantern reading lite, indicator lites for charging tuning power, cellphone charger, etc. Just arrived today, and everything seems to work fine right out of the box - even charged up. Compact and light weight.","positive":1},{"review":"  Awesome Radio. The sound is amazing and the battery still haven`t even died yet for me to charge it USB. It charges so easy just from you even having a light in your house on. This is number one on my Hurricane list next to food.","positive":1},{"review":"  There is a  small part  inside a transparent bag in the packing box.  It is NOT identified anywhere in the User Manual.  See attached picture.

It is exactly as described, holds charge like it says it does. Crank works as described to recharge. Bought to have on hand in case of power outages, and am confident this will do what we need it to, when we need it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I should of bought this years ago.  Really is quite solid, and surprisingly for its size, sounds really good. I bought it for myself, but I certainly imagine everyone has a real need for an emergency device like this. Really good quality for the $$.","positive":1},{"review":"  This emergency radio has a lot of good features. First of all it has three different charging options: crank, solar, and your standard mini USB. Overall so far I've just been using it at home on my windowsill, but this will definitely be coming with next time I go camping. I can also charge my phone off of it which is definitely another great addition.","positive":1},{"review":"  Like most people I'm not buying this for everyday use, but to keep in my emergency bag. It gives great peace of mind knowing I have a battery powered radio, flashlight, and charger ready to go.It's smaller than it looks, perfect for the go bag. Does a lot of things for small space--great for emergencies.","positive":1},{"review":"  This emergency radio has everything- charger, lights, alarm and radio. Love that it is chargeable via cable to always ready and that you can use the hand crank to power it up.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sound on this is Great. The many Channels come in nice and clear. Then I tried a couple times outside with direct sunlight all day, still stayed at 25%, so I'm not sure if it only charges to a certain %, or if the indicator lite is malfunctioned. For the price it's pretty good.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just received and haven`t had a chance to really use it. I bought it because it is small in size and offers a lot of features, flashlight, USB port, radio, weather, battery operated and hand crank. I am going to be using it for access to the outside world when needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this with the anticipation that with the recent hurricane Laura coming our way I may lose power.  I have been in this situation before and with this devise you can hear the radio and also charge your cell phone using the crank or solar panel...","positive":1},{"review":"  The lights and SOS functionality of this radio are very cool. Provides four separate light functions as well as an SOS feature. Sound quality at the radio is warm or as the reception of the radio itself is average. All in all I would still recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just bought this and have had time to fully try everything. Love the multiple ways to power,Lithium, cranking. Only disappointment, I had to get green color because red was sold out. I am fine with green - kind of says it is for emergency usage as we intended it for when buying.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is like the Swiss Army Knife of Solar flashlight radios. I am so happy with it. They were really thinking when they designed this one. I would definitely recommend this for earthquake or disaster kits.","positive":1},{"review":"  Wished we had this the night of Hurricane Sally and afterward for the 4 day power outage. Very compact. Also can charge your phone. Good sound quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  The batteries on this unit, after many hours of listening, are still, according to the built-in indicator, fully charged.  The sound is very good for such a small radio and reception in superb.  I bought this weather radio to replace an older radio whose sound was awful and batteries lasted a few minutes,  so this is a welcome upgrade.","positive":1},{"review":"  Don`t know what review means by warmth. Radio is pretty good, sound is good, I have not yet fully tested the solar charger. It is all plastic, only things I would change are at least make the crank handle metal and maybe add a headphone jack to conserve power.Update: I`ve tried cranking for recharge but still don`t know how much it takes to register.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little thing is pretty good, especially if your working on a small budget bug out bag. This radio has lithium ion battery that can be crank charged, or solar charged. Overall for twenty bucks this little thing offers a lot and can even charge usb devices. I feel this would be great for either a bug out bag, or even hiking and camping, because it also features an SOS mode so if you get separated from a group you can emit a loud siren and flashing red light.","positive":1},{"review":"  opened box, turned on the radio, first station came in loud and clear.

The compact size, ability to use crank to generate electrical power if necessary, and built-in flashlight are especially convenient.  Sound quality is good enough for weather and news casts.","positive":1},{"review":"  Some folks commented too small. My intent was for an emergency kit so I didn`t want something huge. Haven`t put the triple As in yet. Haven`t tried charging my phone on it yet either.","positive":1},{"review":"  In terms of solar charging, it`s not much but seems catching sunlight ( there`s an indicator light on) and hand cranking is fine (a lot of work to charge but again it`s better than nothing)Lights and radio works as it supposed to. It`s nice to have something when you have power outage in your area or going out for camping.I like having it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little thing is pretty awesome.  I live in a rural area and we loose electric every once and awhile and I know this is really going to come in handy. But you always have the crank for charging if needed.  Glad I bought this.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I bought this and tossed it in our emergency kit. Go figure a few months later we have rolling power outages in California and sure enough - we lost power for over 24 hours.. Glad I bought it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this product and bought it for working in the garden.It's actually very nice and can be charged with USB through various options, you can use a solar panel, or you can use a hand crank. I hand cranked it for about 5 minutes and the battery lasts about 20 minutes.The FM radio signal is good and we live in an area with little signal.","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio works exactly as it is advertised (I was expecting at least one wrinkle or two haha), I have already recommended it to a few friends.The form factor is small, so it doesn't take up much space, and the light it gives off is more than sufficient for lighting a dark room. I have admittedly not tested the solar panel yet, but the hand crank definitely works, and will charge a phone. The hand crank is a short throw, so a little more RPM is needed to charge the battery than some larger radios.","positive":1},{"review":"  This combo radio light with hand crank charging ability works very well. I keep it in the house but take it with me in the car when driving. Thinking of buying another one so I can keep one at home and one in the car.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LIKED IT BECAUSE I CAN GET THE EMERGENCY CHANNEL, CRANK IT FOR POWER OR USE SOLAR IN AN EMERGENCY. JUST SOMETHING TO HAVE IN MY DISASTER KIT WITH FIRST AID STUFF, GENERATOR, SHOTGUN ETC. I WANT TO BE PREPARED.","positive":1},{"review":"  The new product is handy for any disaster situation. I live in an area of earthquakes, when,if it occurred, possibly all communications, light and power will be lost. By using the product I could charge my cell phone which would allow me to contact resources needed in that emergency. Similarly, the unit light and radio would be enormous help in in those situations.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve compared several types and jus like Amazon titles it Top Choice or something close to that. I charged it completely then took my iPhone which was at 15% and was able to charge it from the fully charged radio.","positive":1},{"review":"  Smaller than i expected but this product is the real deal. Hopefully we never have to use it in a real emergency but this item is a must have in your \"bug out bag\". Well built and the sound quality is great. We will take this with us on all of our adventures in the outdoors.","positive":1},{"review":"  I mean it's not a Bose, but it does alright for a little radio.  I don't know why it lists \"warmth\" but everything works and works well.  It's a pretty cool little hurricane survival gadget.","positive":1},{"review":"  Long battery life with minimal cranking effort. This was very useful recently with storms and power outages. We were able to keep entertained, phones charged, and have some lights without using candles. Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best little radio I`ve ever had. It almost sounds vintage, which I enjoy because I listen to classical music. 100% recommend..","positive":1},{"review":"  Wish this also had battery \ud83d\udd0b compartment. Lithium items need electricity to recharge and cranking is fine if you have nothing else but what about old ppl with arthritis.  It's a very nice radio after all.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the  money this is an unbeatable little device to keep with you anywhere you go in a vehicle or just to leave in your house.Highly recommend and already buying another one.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0I just got this item and had not seen one before, but was able to just crank it by hand a few times, turn it on, and was listening to a very detailed weather report within about a minute of opening the box. Very cool little device. I live on an island in hurricane territory and this is forecast to be a heavy hurricane year. I feel much better knowing I have a way non-battery:electrical-outlet-dependent way to access emergency information should I lose internet and cellular data access.","positive":1},{"review":"  They say in a disaster you need a radio just like this so I bought this after some research. Its wild just how many ways it can power up hand crank, batteries and USB and some others I haven't read into yet.The sound quality isn't the greatest, but this isn't meant to be for entertainment. Having this little guy gives me piece of mind.","positive":1},{"review":"  Worked great when tested. Purchased for an emergency bag and it will do the job well the light is bright and the unit is easy to use. Very happy with this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Isaias was headed straight for us and I made sure that I had everything charged up and ready to go. I felt so much safer having a weather radio, external battery, and flashlight, all in one.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have three of these and love em. I have one on the balcony for radio and In the kitchen and one that I keep in my backpack. You don`t even need an emergency, you can just chill and listen to the radio.

It's great for camping, and I can charge it off the USB power port on my motorcycle.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wasn`t expecting this quality for the price. It`s exactly what I wanted. You won`t be disappointed. I`ve recommended to family and friends.","positive":1},{"review":"  it works and tested it on my phone. you need this if there is an earthquake or loss of power. my car battery can only last so long, plus i could not even buy gas with debit card, so keep some cash around too. things to think about, and this item gives me a big relief.","positive":1},{"review":"  We got it and started using you're preparing for a possible hurricane and it was totally  awesome.

Very impressed it picked up my favorite radio station,  considering we live in a hole reception wise.","positive":1},{"review":"  The only thing I would have preferred on this item is digital tuning but it has many feature for such a low price.

It's intended for short-term use, it's not a regular plug-in radio.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this crank battery solar radio to prepare for my hurricane readiness kit.  I especially like the multiple level LED flashlight + LED reading light features and clear AM FM radio reception.  Not sure if the USB charge and SOS Alarm will be necessary for my needs but good add-ons  if used outdoors.  One drawback might be is having a turndial for the radio stations versus a digital button.","positive":1},{"review":"  This weather band radio was delivered on July 27, 2020.

I like that you can charge three different ways depending on the circumstances. The radio stations come in clear.  The lights are clear and bright and it is all in one small package.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this radio, it's multiple functions in one, my husband and I are in our sixties and no longer go hiking or camping, but we live in the middle of nowhere and this radio keeps us up to date on what's happening or about to happen, which is very satisfying.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it, but the plastic handle that winds it broke within a week.

Everything you need for a hurricane or many other situations.  Definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my wife. We are both teachers and the laminators in the library, big ones that cost several hundred dollars and no one is allowed to use without special training, are constantly out of commission for various reasons..\" Keep momma happy and everyone is happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am preschool special education teacher and am constantly laminating to preserve items for years to come. I usually use card stock and 5ml pouches and needed a laminator that could accommodate constant usage and thick projects, especially something that could get hot enough - nothing is more annoying than open corners. It also laminates fairly quickly. I would absolutely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my classroom because the school laminator is always broken and makes such thin products.  This was such a relief to have my first year as a sped teacher.  Also, don't let the sheets sit in the machine when they are done or the end will curl permanently.  Great price and I wholeheartedly recommend this laminator.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product was very easy to use.  Our school laminator breaks so often that this was a good buy for the money.  It is not designed for small pieces that have been cut out and need laminating as the pouches feed at about a 70 degree angle making the pieces slide together.  This was definitely a good buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0This laminator is great. It's extremely basic, but it can handle most lamination projects.I really recommend this. Even if you're only going to laminate once or twice over the next few years, I still think you should get it.","positive":1},{"review":"  A teacher at work told me that laminators didn't have to cost an arm and a leg and were better than what is offered at our school.  I ran across this looking for something else.You can actually cut things out that were laminated and it doesn't come apart.  So far everything has stayed intact, this is something the school's machine would never be able to do.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am an elementary school teacher and I am so glad I invested in this product. I have been researching different laminators and finally decided on this one. This is the best investment. I just wish I had bought one years ago.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this on Prime Day (ordered two, actually) and wanted to give it some time before reviewing it. I used both of them for a few days before deciding for sure that they were going to do the job for me and for my new teacher daughter. it just wasn't a perfect solution. Still, I got these for about $27 each---what a steal.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my first thermal laminator. It was easy to use and sure beats trying to laminate pages by hand, where you get air bubbles, wrinkles, or edges not lined up perfectly. The machine takes over from there, feeding the lamimating envelope automatically as the heat perfectly seals your item inside. For small items you can place several inside the lamination envelope as long as you space items apart so that there are clear edges between items.","positive":1},{"review":"  Let me just say right up front that I'm a geezer, and when you become one as well, you'll wonder why Medicare (and Delta Dental, for that matter) sends you a paper ID card that will begin to get dog-eared and frayed after presenting it to your health providers and going in and out of your wallet a few times. This is the perfect answer, and the modest price of the machine is less than it would have cost me to go to a store to have my wife's, my neighbor's and my cards laminated professionally (they actually use a machine just like this one). Just make sure you let the machine warm up fully before you begin using it, and feed the documents in carefully. A well made product that reliably does exactly what it says it will.","positive":1},{"review":"  Laminator literally burnt a hole in itself with only one use.

It is ridiculous and I`m thankful that I stood there and watched it heat up and so forth because who knows if I had kept it plugged in if it would have caught fire or what. I would not buy this product if I were you.","positive":0},{"review":"  Plugged it in, when the ready light came on it seemed to blow a fuse.

But it just stopped working after a few uses ...","positive":0},{"review":"  This little machine is magic. I don't know how it could be any easier to use. The machine did not need to cool down during this project. Apparently, it does that automatically if needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like that this was a great deal and the brand usually lives up to its name. The design is nice except the fact that when you insert the sheet it goes in diagonally or at least a 160 degree angle. Regular paper works just fine(folded once or not), the laminated sides of the paper are sealed nicely compared to cardstock. Next time, I hope to look for one that lays as flat as possible to avoid the having to hold the sheet until it goes into the feeder.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm in love.  As a teacher, lamination is a way of life.  You literally insert pouch and wait for it to come out.  My only gripe is I wish this was double in length so I can laminate 2 pouches side by side and cut my prep time in half.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this laminator. Overall, it works great. It surely doesn`t ruin my day and I still like the machine.Bottom line: This is a good laminator for the money so I would recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  For *light-duty* use (a few sheets at a time, occasionally) in home, office, or school, this machine has worked great for me. At this price, and given the light feel of it, I would not recommend buying this to churn out several hundred laminated sheets per day over the long haul. (TIP:  Fiddle with the angle of the back shelf until your pouch goes easily in, and don't pull it out. And remember that you will need to buy laminating pouches as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update to review: I had contacted 3M customer care, and they responded positively, after some clarifications and providing them the required information, they did replace the unit for me under warranty free of cost, just took around 2-4 weeks. But overall I appreciate and admire them for their customer-centric attitude, I admire a company when they stand behind their product and honor the warranties, etc. As of today when I powered it on, it came on but then died. I've reached out to Scotch to see if warranty will cover it, will update the review if anything is remediated by Scotch.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought the Scotch Thermal Laminator to laminate the nearly 900 cards I use playing Firefly. It does a very good job. If you print photos with a ink jet printer you must laminate them or risk the ink running from the eventual water drops that will fall on it.

Is the first one I own and it does the work , its light weight.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update: I tried the laminator again because it dawned on me that I was trying to use it the wrong way.

Do yourself a favor and use the laminator a few times before the return window closes.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've used it to laminat signs in my classroom the past month. It's fast, efficient, doesn't smell, doesn't jam and the the signs are holding up to daily child use.

I would highly recommend for teachers.","positive":1},{"review":"  If I'd written this when I first received it, I would have rated it positively. However, after having it only a little over two months of light use (for home school) it over-heated itself and quit.

Don't buy this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered my first no-jam laminator and I was very excited because my old one had started to jam.

Unfortunately, the one I was sent did not appear to be new. The heat output of the unit seems sufficient. Based on the quality control and design of the unit I would not recommend this laminator.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm returning it because the rollers are defective - or a roller is defective.  Everything I laminate has, at equal intervals, horizontal lines creases across the laminated pages.  I really liked this laminator but I might try a different model after returning this one.  I'd hate to order the same one and end up with the same issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered mine on May 28 and got it a few days later. It is now Nov 1 and it just quit working..this was just a waste for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  Sadly, I let this unit sit new in the box for over 8 months.

Claims to turn off after an hour but I literally left it on for a few minutes while I gathered the docs I was going to laminate and it burned out and never turned back on.

Won`t repurchase again ESPECIALLY after reading that I was not the only this happened to.","positive":0},{"review":"  Admittedly, I bought this product almost 2 years ago but it has sat in the box unopened until today.

I read articles outside of amazon as well placing this one as the best value laminator of 2019 so I bought it. Don`t buy any other one..","positive":1},{"review":"  In the past, we always went to Fedex Business Office to laminate Professional Identity Cards, BMV and Proof of Insurance Cards, etc.  Over time, Fedex has more than double the cost and none of their machine work correctly often times producing numerous bubbles in the laminations.

Highly recommend the Scotch Thermal Laminator TL906.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this about 8 months ago and have used about two full packs on laminating sheets with it. I have had no problems so far. Also, if it doesn't melt all the way and looks milky, run it through again and it will be perfectly clear. For 30-something bucks, this was a great buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Does what it should reliably at a very reasonable price with a safety feature that works. . It was just difficult when the recall was first announced. Since I was able to wait, it got easier to get through to the phone and mail the cord back using their online process to get the refund issued.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is not my first Scotch laminator and I loved my last ones- in fact they still work after thousands of pages, but the tray broke, so I thought I'd try the fold in tray model. This machine works great and I love the fold down tray. however, I wish it would move the sheets through a bit faster as big jobs can take longer and don't seem to seal any different with the Pro version than with the regular model.","positive":1},{"review":"  It would have been nice to have a longer feeding tray so your small pieces on the tray don't slip into each other. The laminating sheet does not exit the machine on its own. I have been through 150 laminating sheets with this machine since it arrived about 3 weeks ago. I found that it takes about 5 minutes for the laminator to heat up and be ready.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have yet to use this with more than one item that needed lamination, so I have no truly tested how well it stay at temp. That being said it only took a couple minutes to heat up. The heat sealed the lamination well no air bubbles . Perfectly heated and sealed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this little appliance. I am a fourth grade teacher, and although I do have access to a larger laminator in our staff room, it isn't always loaded with laminate, and it requires planning ahead to turn it on to preheat, and is just not convenient to use at all. It heats up quickly, is incredibly lightweight and easy to transport so I can use it when it is convenient for me, and produces laminated projects that come out even better than those from the huge model at school. I can't believe I waited so long to make this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  The title says it all: I use this thing constantly. I'm an elementary art teacher, and I bought this before I started at my current school.do it. It'll serve you well.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's decent for the price.  Pretty cheaply made.  If you are laminating multiple items in 1 8.5x11 sheet, they need to be spaced pretty far apart otherwise, the heat doesn't completely seal in between the items.","positive":0},{"review":"  I  previously owned a Purple Cow laminator and loved it.  But a class project ruined it.  I don't see it heating up that well because my sheets are not always sealed well to what I am laminating.  Going back to Purple Cow after this one goes out.","positive":0},{"review":"  My laminator worked great until it died only 8 months later. If I were to do the math I laminated about 400 sheets at most and it stopped working. If you are purchasing this laminator expect it to only last for a short amount of time. I will not purchase it again due to it`s lifespan.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was a good laminator and a good value for the price, but it only lasted 4 months..  I will need to order a new one and sadly, it will not be this same one.  Maybe this would be better for home minimal use.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've endured hours of frustration over this laminator.  I've read the manual at least 5 times, I've watched videos online of people using the machine, I've made sure I have the right sizes for everything\u2014yet this thing jams literally every.  I highly highly recommend you chose a different product and from a different company.  I feel very cheated, and I think I should get my money back.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s a fairly simple straightforward machine that is far from perfect but is budget friendly.The sides do curl and the picture you`re laminating gets stuck once the picture is past the roller and then you have to manually pull it the rest of the way. I wouldn`t recommend using it preserve important documents or one of a kind items. I`m going to return this and get a different model with less issues.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laminator during my last semester of college as an Education major. This year, I have used it in my own classroom. The pages are hot upon exiting the machine. I always worried about the reviews that say the machine melts burns, but I did not have that problem.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased in November and did not even open the box until today.  I read the directions thoroughly and followed them.  No luck.  The laminator appears to be easy to use but is useless to me.","positive":0},{"review":"  This machine laminates well - the heat is a good level. However, the design is terrible. If it was a straight entry, I would easily give it a 5 star rating - it's lightweight, easy to store, laminates well. Too bad it has a terrible design.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laminator works ok but has a major design flaw. It does not completely eject the sheet after the heating process. Every other laminator I have used in the past fully ejects the sheet.

Looking forward to using this ALL THE TIME.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laminating machine in order to preserve some family holy cards.

This machine is well worth the price, works as advertised, and does a beautiful looking job.  I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this thermal laminator after my previous Scotch one that I loved very much was recalled.  :   I still really liked my previous one and never had any problems personally, so I decided to give this one a try.  Still, I would say it does a great job, heats up relatively quickly, and does a good job making quality laminations.  I would recommend the Scotch laminators.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`m really loving how easy this laminator is to use. It`s ridiculously easy to set up and instructions are to the point and easy to understand. Great price for this handy device.

It not only sticks to the plastic, it sticks to the paper.","positive":1},{"review":"  WOW.. Great for teachers and any crafters..","positive":1},{"review":"  My old laminator took a dive after quite a few years and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I originally purchased the Amazon recommended one but it didn't work.  Once I got the hang of it, it was just fine.  Hope I remember to put it in from the back the next time I use it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this product for work. I have been using it for a month and I'm pretty happy with it, for a cheap laminator it seals nicely. The only problem I have with this laminator is that it's not a front loader (I'm not sure if that is mentioned in the description) - so it can get kind of hard when I'm laminating a few small signs together on one sheet. Beware: it takes a while to get hot.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laminator is great - the size is nice, the design is modern and simplistic, and it is not bulky. It looks nice sitting on my craft room desk. I use it for photos, card stock, news paper articles, etc. My son uses it for baseball cards and other odds and ends.","positive":1},{"review":"  So at first I was really excited about this little laminator. Carefully read all the instructions plug it in, and it warmed up exactly as described. A couple hours later I came back to laminate something else and it never again powered up. So when it works I think its great, but since it only worked once I think there is definitely a major problem with the manufacturing and or quality assurance of this item and not worth the money.","positive":0},{"review":"  The anti-jam technology is a crock.  We cut lots of snowflakes every year and then laminate for re-use.  Tedious.  I`ll be looking for another brand.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have used Scotch laminators before, but this model is a potential fire hazard. I ordered one, and on my first use, the machine started smoking, jammed, and powered down automatically and wouldn't power back on. Wouldn't recommend this model. Hoping I have more luck with my next purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laminator is not cheap to be purchasing a new one every time it breaks.  This is my second one and it just stopped working today.  I teach and love to have a laminator in a quick pinch.  Time to find a new one - AGAIN.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product worked well for the few times I used it, I got 5 mil sheets and they would often come out a bit hazy but running them twice as per the instructions usually helped to clear that up most of the time.One night it decided to just overheat during a job and it got stuck and couldn't do anything to get it out. After it cooled hours later I opened it up and the insides were absolutely fried and melted.Can't say I recommend it for just the few jobs you'll get out of it before it desides to make itself obsolete.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this product in February of 2019. It has worked fined until today...","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this 2 times. I loved it's ease of use and it seemed to be working well. Something is wrong with this laminator. It should be pulled off the shelves and repaired.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this model when my first laminator was recalled by 3M and man, do I wish I had not returned my other device. This one claims to be easy to use but it is a righteous pain in the fourth point of contact. I spend more time trying to get the pouch to feed than I do anything else. It gets to the point I have to think if I really, really, want that item laminated.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a teacher and bought this to use in my classroom.  I used it for a few months and then packed it away for summer break.  The value for the money was poor since it only worked for a short period of time.  To me it is a lot to spend on something that does not last more than a few months and only used a handful of times.","positive":0},{"review":"  I use laminators regularly to prepare homeschool materials. I print and laminate lots of documents every week. The warm up time is several minutes which is disappointing.

I love the input tray and ease of removing any jams. However, I just pulled it through to get it unstuck without damaging the card or the laminator. I'll know that for the future.","positive":1},{"review":"  LOVE this laminator. I am a homeschool mom and I had a bazillion tiny things that I wanted to reuse, and I thought it would be cheaper to get the self laminating pouches. SO glad I went for this instead. Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a replacement for a model that was discontinued. It doesn't jam and works fine. I usually use for a few minutes, turn it off, and wait a few minutes to resume my job. For this reason, it would not be good for industrial use but for occasional use at home, it's fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  I previously had another brand of laminator that cost a lot more. It broke down after about a year of use which was incredibly disappointing. Lol. This machine is an absolute gem.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have used this a few times since I purchased it and have run 20-40 sleeves through it each time.  The heating element seems to work very well and all of the laminate has been sealed.  I am looking forward to using this many more times. It is small and light weight and very convenient and easy to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  My husband was the first to use it. It's been something I've always wanted.  I purchased a box of the 8 1 2 x 11 inch laminating sheets, too.  I probably will order the card-size ones for the recipes.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is amazing. I spent a good amount of time looking to buy one in the store, so it was tangible, but no such luck.  I only ran into a jam one time and it was because of the angle you insert the paper, it can get stuck. But luckily, since its anti jam and I frantically pulled it out , it ruined the paper and press, but didnt ruin the machine, I call that a win.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wore my old Scotch laminator out.  As a teacher it was heavily used until the heating element went out.  This new version is so much more compact and easier for me to transport from home to school.  I do wish that the guide on the side had higher edges to ensure that the paper is going in straight because it can be a real mess when it goes in cock-eyed.","positive":1},{"review":"  Horrible quality.

Horrible quality, disappointed I didn`t put my money into a better one after the first product failed.","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought that this was a great purchase -- very easy to use.

Scotch should be ashamed of themselves for selling it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was extremely excited to haves laminator to preserve important documents and awards from my children.

However, the entrance at the top of the machine did not allow paper to pass through easily...","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this during the prime day sale during the Summer since I was starting my clinic portion of my graduate program in the Fall and knew it would come in handy for making materials.

Very frustrating, especially as a broke grad student.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought it only 4 months ago and broke already. Used it here and there nothing crazy went to laminate something and it wont turn on, tried another plug, nope still nothing.

Wont buy again it just isnt worth the price for it to die on me so soon.","positive":0},{"review":"  Stopped working. This was actually the 3rd  time I bought this laminator...","positive":0},{"review":"  I really liked this laminator when I first bought it.  I bought it July 12, 2019.  That is why I am writing this review.  I do not want this to happen to someone else.","positive":0},{"review":"  My older laminator with the \"Scotch\" brand logo on it lasted years & years.  This cheaply made unit didn't make it to its' first birthday.  Very, very disappointing- yet another shadow of a brand name that no longer means quality.  I'll be seeking a different brand for the replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  As the title states, this thing crapped the bed after a little over a year of moderate use. My SO took apart the machine and inspected the inner workings. Get a better laminator that will last for a long time. Not one that will turn into garbage within a year.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for work to do some laminating at home and it is seriously the most perfect product. If it weren't for some of the bigger things I need to laminate for work, I would laminate EVERYTHING at home. This laminator heats up quick, does NOT jam at all, and laminates effortlessly and beautifully.","positive":1},{"review":"  Much better than the $17 regular Scotch laminator.","positive":1},{"review":"  Easy to use, you need 0 knowledge to begin using. I've never had it warp or bubble laminations, nor get stuck. Perfect size to take with you places, use at school, or at home in your office.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to laminate flash cards for my toddler to keep them from being bent, chewed, torn and otherwise destroyed. It does the trick. Haven`t had any issues. I plan on using it for laminating handwriting practice pages for when he is older and learning to write, since dry erase markers will wipe off the laminated sheet.","positive":1},{"review":"  My wife asked me for this for her use but I have found lots of uses for it myself. It works well.  I noticed too. The film is soft and flexible but after running it through the laminator it gets hard and stiff.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this last summer and it sat on a shelf until I had a good place to use it. I successfully laminated several items, then I took it to school to finish. My wonderful husband is currently sitting on the floor methodically taking the laminator apart, while trying to unjam it. It is not user friendly when trying to unjam it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my wife as she is a teacher and she absolutely loves it..It leaves no bubbles or anything either, it looks perfectly professionally done. The price was amazing at $33 I couldn't ask for much more.","positive":1},{"review":"  We had bought one of these a few years ago for our daughter (a teacher).  She uses it quite often.  When we realized that we also had lots of things that needed to be laminated, we bought one for ourselves.","positive":1},{"review":"  Being a preschool teacher, I can't even tell you how often I've had to replace my laminator because of paper jams.. I like the top little rack that i can just put it in and I know the kids projects will come out perfect. I especially like that I can wrap the cord underneath and put on the top of my cabinet without any cords dangling around.","positive":1},{"review":"  People always act like laminators cost hundreds of dollars and are only for HR departments or businesses. My friends are always amazed when I have fancy, laminated cards or papers and think I spend money to have it done at the library or something. This little machine works very well and it's super simple. I can fit three 4\" x 6\" index cards at a time through this machine and I've run 8\" x 11\" cardstock no problem.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased for minimal use with 60-80lb cardstock. Worked decently for about 6 months. For an extra $30 I would purchase a higher quality machine in the future. overall it gets the job done and is acceptable.","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved this laminator. I was a first year teacher last year and this laminator lasted me for only one school year. Is there any way I can send it back and have someone repair it. I really liked it and am willing to give it another try.","positive":0},{"review":"  Now it will only progress 1-2\" before it turns itself off. I can sometimes get it to finish the job by constantly pressing the on off button, and half the time it just stops working altogether, and needs to sit there for 10-15 minutes before it will turn back on.maybe five times per month. I didn't successfully contact 3M until after the year mark, so they wouldn't replace it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laminator when my last scotch died thinking it is the same brand it will be great. Yeah not so much. I have had nothing but trouble with this thing. As a teacher I need a reliable machine and this is not it.","positive":0},{"review":"  We ordered this product for office use when our last one broke. The heat, lamination and ease of use were good to begin with but it stopped working after 2 1 2 months of light office use. Update, I called Scotch directly and they are sending a replacement so thats a plus.  However, it doesnt solve my immediate need.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I first purchased this May 2018 it worked great. Stopped working January 2019, not heating. because of this poor rating. As long as it does not stop working, not a bad machine.","positive":0},{"review":"  The tray is slanted so it only works well on a single page and not for cards . Some of my flashcards got ruined because they slid forward just before going into the machine. After that I had to keep stopping and moving cards as they went through to make sure that they didn`t touch or overlap.","positive":0},{"review":"  First run smelled very bad like burning plastic, figured it just normal for first run. After three sheets the unimaginable happened from a Jam-Free laminator, it Jammed...","positive":0},{"review":"  This laminator would have easily received a 5 star review in my book.. I hope that Scotch will reach out and make this right.I'd be more than happy to update my review if this issue gets resolved.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`m a preschool teacher and bought this to use in my classroom. I read some of the reviews about it smoking but thought I would get lucky and I wouldn`t have the same problem. I will definitely be returning this and am honestly so disappointed in this product. Now my room smells like burnt plastic and I am still without a working laminator.","positive":0},{"review":"  This item does a very good job at the most important tasks:  (1) It fully heats melts the plastic sheet without getting too hot, and (2) it feeds smoothly & straight through the rollers.  There are so many uses for laminating items that it's crazy.  When I was a school teacher I used them to laminate items for long-term wall use.  I'm certain there are a zillion uses in various crafts.","positive":1},{"review":"  A nice product to have, especially in a time like this. I do tons of arts and crafts being stuck at home with my kids and I have never used this so much, out of almost a year that I had this in my possession. Never had a problem so far and I do recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  Use this everyday with my preschool projects and supplies. Nice size , laminates well two sheet sizes.","positive":1},{"review":"  The kids will be learning from home thanks to COVID-19. I purchased this laminator to laminate papers for my kids for their school work. I`ve done over a 100 pages including some thicker pieces and so far and I haven`t had any jams and no bubbling. If you`re looking for a reasonably priced laminator that gets the job done this one is for you.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this product for three years now and still works well. It is not meant for heavy duty constant lamenting but will work well for notebook sized papers used in classrooms. The lamination does hold up very well. I would recommend this product for those needing to do small lamination projects.","positive":1},{"review":"  We have used this item a lot since receiving it a few weeks ago.  It is VERY simple and works great.  The plastic smell is not enjoyable but it comes with the territory, so we use it in a large open space with ventilation.  I would not recommend using it in a small office for that reason.","positive":1},{"review":"  Replacing an older Scotch laminator that was recalled for safety.  This one works exactly as it should, takes a little time to warm up, but offers 2 levels of heat based on thickness.  Never jams, just gets hot and rolls lamination through without issue.","positive":1},{"review":"  Reviews are accurate.  Easy to use.  I make print my own custom made calendars and laminate them enabling me to write on them with Dry Erase markers.  I also make lists and charts which I also mark on with Dry Erase markers enabling me to make changes and reuse my forms.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just laminated my Global Recognition Awards from work.  It was fast, easy to use and the finishing product looks great.  For me it's worth the money.  Thanks again for such a great product not to big to store away it's just right.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love to laminate my colorings. Glitter just \"pops\" when the heat seals it in and my pictures last almost forever. Of course, I do slow down if I see corners turning and the such. A great purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I used this laminator for a little over a year, and was very happy with it, until last week when it ate up an entire 81 2 by 11 laminating sheet, and that's the end of my laminator.. I am very surprised, as there are many other stores that give much better customer service. I don't know why they can't just believe me and send me a new one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really liked this laminator and it was working great for me until a day ago. I was laminating a sheet and it somehow got stuck inside the laminator and would not come out..Sucks cause I had it for less than 6 months.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this Scotch Pro Thermal Laminator trusting that it was made by a well-known and reliable manufacturer.  That was nine months ago and it was only used a half dozen times during that period.  All of the lights just went out and its short life was over.  I will not buy another Scotch product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Junk I used this one time to test it out and it worked beautifully. Fast forward 6 months when Im ready to start using it for my classroom and it won`t turn on. It`s way past returnable and I`m stuck with nothing. Don`t waste your money.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was super excited in the first 6 months.  It worked great - while it worked.  I am going to try to send the company a message.  It seems like this is an error warning, but I can't find any information on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this laminator based on the reviews. I read all the operating instructions. That one was exactly the same. Piece of garbage.","positive":0},{"review":"  PIECE OF GARBAGE.. It started to melt into the machine and I had to force it out with my hands and pull so hard. Machine smells like fire from when it was turned out.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laminator to replace the recalled one (that worked perfectly) last month and was excited to upgrade. The first time I used this laminator, it worked perfectly. I`m very disappointed \u2014 as a teacher I use a personal laminator weekly. Definitely looking at a non-Scotch brand laminator next.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am so dissapointed. I wanted this laminator for my school counseling small group. But I was let down. I encourage others not to purchase this laminator, if you do not want this headache please spend money on a laminator that is worth your time and money.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a middle school teacher.  I bought this laminator for personal use in my classroom. When I pulled it out on Thursday to use - first time this school year, it was not working - broke.  I have to buy another one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got my laminator to laminate classroom center activities. It`s my very first laminator and I love it . I received it the same day I ordered it and it works perfectly. It`s such a convenient size and you can easily store the wire in the back when you`re not using it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have owned two of these Scotch laminator. The first one after about 6 no of flawless use would not power on.  Will be looking for a other model that will last longer then 6 motor a year.  Any e have suggestions.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love love love having my own laminator. I went back and forth on getting one since we have a laminator at school, but I love how thick this laminator makes copy paper which in turn makes them more durable. It`s easy to use and laminating is so satisfying. If I could change one thing I wish it could go a bit faster.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works perfectly I use it all the time and it does a great job every time it just depends on the sheets you use. Also make sure to let it heat up for a while it has a light that indicates ready just pay attention to it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this machine. Never used one before but using the instructions it was very easy. Very happy with this product..","positive":1},{"review":"  I've wanted a thermal laminator for a long time and after reading some reviews on this one, I finally took the plunge.  My only regret is that I waited so long.  If i'm laminating cardstock pieces, I sometimes (very occasionally) will have to send it through twice -- not becuase it isn't sealed, but because the laminating pouch is a little cloudy and I'm just trying to heat it up a little more to correct that.  Love, love, love this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this to use for my classroom. 3mm and 5mm pouches no problem, depending on paper thickness finished product curves upward sometimes but easily fixed by bending in opposite direction for a few seconds. Has already paid for itself. Laminating itself is a little slow and remeber to puch the guide flap all the way down or the pouches will not feed properly.","positive":1},{"review":"  Geez. What can I say.Thanks 3M Office Products. You rock.","positive":1},{"review":"  This one replaces a similar laminator that died after about 10 years of use.  Same brand, but the new one is even simpler to use and handles larger sheets.  I especially like that the cord has a space built-in to wind it up and keep it out of the way.  Quick to warm and easy to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laminator does the trick for your household or school craft projects.  I just love having it handy.  I'm really enjoying it.  Why didn't I buy this sooner.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this product last Christmas f or my daughter whose a teacher. Today was her third time attempting to use it and it wouldn`t turn on. It worked fine the first two times. What type of warranty does your company give for a product that stops working after only two uses, and not even a full year.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this July of 18 and haven`t even used it 50 times since then. Went to turn it on today after doing about 15 pages yesterday and nothing. But don`t buy it if you haven`t already. I`m gonna try Amazons brand.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm a preschool teacher and this year with my tax dollars I decided to treat myself to my own laminator so I could laminate activities at home and not just at school.  Every time I've used it jams at least three times unless I stand right there and hold each page as it comes out.  I keep ruining cards I've made for classroom.  I would not reccommend this laminator and would strongly encourage you to buy from another company.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laminator in August of 2018. It's September 2019 and it no longer works. I wonder if mine is just a dud. Would love if the company would replace it for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  This seemed like a really great buy.  As a teacher, having a laminator really helps to protect materials students use.  Again, do not waste your money on this laminator.  Shop around.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this machine March 2018. I was excited because it claimed to be jam free and no misfeeds.I have laminated many things in the past and was surprised by the sudden malfunction.I would not recommend this machine as it hasn't lasted a year.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this laminator last year. I was planning to homeschool for this year so to prepare the sheets I switched on the laminator and it gave a burning smell. Never switching back again. I feel so sad cause so many good reviews here and this happed to me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I order our first one of these and the laminator didn't work after just a few weeks.  Luckily the machine broke down within the return window so I was able to return it and I bought the same machine again.  I am going to purchase a bigger, more expensive one similar to what we used before.  That one lasted a few years without any problems.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really excited to use this in my classroom. It heated quickly and got the job done at a great price. I tried several different plugs but it never turned back on. I had it about seven months before this happened.","positive":0},{"review":"  While it worked, it was great. Stopped working after 3 months for no apparent reason. I didn't think I had to purchase the warranty, but I was wrong. If you decide to purchase this laminator, make sure to get the replacement warranty for just a few bucks more.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this the day after Thanksgiving last year for a deal and it has been a great machine to use. I have been laminating my children's art work and favorite projects. It warms up super fast and seals great. This is not something I would normally splurge on, but very glad I did.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve had this for a while before I wrote the review. This is one of my best purchases so far. I definitely recommend this..","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a must have. I love this product for my job and personal life.. I was hesitant to buy it at first but I love it so much now, I`ll never not have one again.","positive":1},{"review":"  After using another brand for years I tried this one. It was so nice not to lose my work through the machine eating it. This one works great for me and it is so simple to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this laminator. It doesnt get hot through the casing but works very well and firmly laminates all densities of paper. I use it almost daily in my classroom and love its sleek design. It is large enough to do full size paper but fits nicely in a cabinet.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this at a great price but wasnt sure what I needed it for. My kids have been home this week and they had a blast making signs for their room and laminating them.  We also made our our chore charts and laminated them to use with washable markers, and I've laminated some important papers.","positive":1},{"review":"  Smoked a bit at first, but stopped after the first couple minutes of use.  I`m thinking it was burning off the oil from manufacturing. Works great since.  No issues.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this laminator. I am a teacher and I was originally using contact paper to laminate at home. With the scotch laminating sheets you can laminate a regular paper size and it's extremely thick and durable. The only thing is I wish they had bigger ones for posters.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am extremely happy with this laminator. I am a teacher, and I have a small business on the side, so I have had plenty of chances to use the laminator already. I like it so much better than the school laminator for things like my classroom card games, and things I'm hanging on the wall because the lamination comes out so much thicker. Very nice .","positive":1},{"review":"  Does a good job of laminating items that I want to keep without them becoming frayed and worn too badly to use. Does a great job and is very easy to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had this lamination machine for about 18 months.  I used it a bit right after I got it and then rarely after that.  That was it.I liked it while it lasted but overall I am pretty disappointed that this machine was only able to laminate a total of 60 pages.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked fine with the small pouches for cards and IDs, but when I inserted a full sheet of laminate to make a handout, it curled up the leading corner  edge of the laminate on the side next to the on.off switch. Told me to contact Amazon for warranty. Still trying to find out from Amazon about warranty.","positive":0},{"review":"  Used @ 7 times for various projects. Stored in a drawer in desk and  used only 3M material. No laminating . No  happy.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have only had this machine for less than two months and won't stay on long enough for me to get two pages through before it shuts off. Then when I turn back on to put another piece through it shuts off right before it finishes and I have to quickly turn it back on for it to come out...","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a teacher and have been using this laminator for a little over a month preparing materials for my classroom. I have laminated about 200 sheets, doing about 20-50 at a time, which has not been a problem. Then it works fine. Other than that it works perfectly.","positive":0},{"review":"  Other than the product was not new, it worked.One issue I had and - making sure the film was flat and shoved it in, but when it came out the corners were bent up and back. Luckily in my case the item was way smaller.Also had a hard time getting it to feed into the machine.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this item a month ago and just went to use it for the first time. It started smelling like something was burning then it started smoking. I got it, plugged it in and this was smoking again and smelling like something was burning. I'm returning it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Since most of the reviews were glowing and only a few said it stopped working, I took a chance and bought this product.  Like the other 1-star reviews, mine quit working after only 3 uses.  Now the machine won't even turn on.  I would not recommend this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm so frustrated that I'm only just now seeing the reviews that this product will randomly completely stop working. I ordered a little over 2 months ago. The rollers work so I can put papers through the machine but nothing is heating the paper. Disappointed I wasted my money on this unreliable product.","positive":0},{"review":"  this product is terrible never have i had so many issues with a laminator eating and destroying documents before , the only reason i purchased was to replace a recalled laminator from scotch that worked amazing , save your self the hassle and money and buy a better one ....","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this laminator and it works great. I have had no problems with it. I've also laminated certificates and recipes with it. It's amazingly quiet too.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ok I am mostly happy with this except for just one thing. As it warms up it totally smells like burning plastic. It did this the very first time before I ever ran anything through it and I figured that the smell would eventually go away but it hasn't. Every time I use it there is a burning plastic smell that's a bit noxious.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to use for school items. It is fairly easy to use, heats up quickly, and was a good price. It does a better job than the  laminating machine at my school.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this thing. I've used it to laminate training material for driving so they don't get ruined on the boat, and even used it to laminate missing cat fliers so they couldn't just get torn in half. It's amazing how many things you end up wanting to laminate once you can :-DThe machine itself works great. It's simple, clean, small footprint.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a teacher, and there are times when laminating at school is not convenient, nor is the quality that great.  However, after purchasing the Scotch PRO Thermal Laminator to laminate materials for my centers and signs, I wonder why I didn't purchase this machine earlier.  I'm very pleased with the quality of lamination output.  I would highly recommend this unit to friends and family.","positive":1},{"review":"  How did I live without this. Originally, I thought a laminator would be a waste of money for something I would only use once in a while. This makes it so easy to make durable items. Works great, easy to use and laminates quickly.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laminator is awesome. I have never used a laminator but this one was so easy, fast and laminated beautifully. I also love that the machine itself is light weight and clean. Very happy with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0great product - does the job.  I would like to mention that the instructions mentions 3 & 5 ml thickness, but the pouches box does not.  I found one here that was listed as 5 ml in the description, but the scotch brand that I got did not.  I think it would be beneficial for that to be listed since the thickness is mentioned on the instructions.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am so glad I bought this. Now I can laminate at the comfort of my house. The quality is amazing. My teachers friends have been getting them too because it is practical to have it in the classroom.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am so happy with this purchase. I went around and around on whether or not I needed to get a laminator. It's quiet and very small. I can easily store it in my closet and it is not cumbersome.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good while it lasted. ...","positive":0},{"review":"  When it worked, it was great. I`ve had it less than four months and it has just stopped working. Super disappointed. This is a product I NEED for work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`m disappointed in this purchase. I cut out various letters for classroom decoration and wanted to laminate them so that they would look nice and last longer. Not sure, just disappointed as I`ve just started using it and missed the return window. I wouldn`t recommend this machine.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very disappointed.  Unit heated quickly but would not accept my Staples laminator pocket.Am returning for refund and paying 3 times as much for a Fellowes laminator.  I am an artist and teacher and I just need a machine that works, reliably.","positive":0},{"review":"  Disappointed that this only lasted 5 months. My last laminator (which was even cheaper) lasted me for 8 years with lots and lots of use until one day I jammed it so badly that it broke. I went to turn this one on today and it won't turn on. Time to buy a new laminator.","positive":0},{"review":"  First purchase of a laminator. Brand is well know and reputable. I will be calling Scotch customer service to see what they can do. If anything.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had used this laminator several times with no issues. Today it caught on fire. My friend and I both burnt our fingers more than once trying to release the paper. Very disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this laminator at the beginning of the summer to I could work on projects for my classroom over break. It worked great for a couple of months (maybe 50 sheets worth over the span of 2 months) and I was pretty happy with it. I purchased this one because I had a very high opinion of the Scotch brand and was willing to pay a little extra for what I thought was a quality brand and quality product. However, I may end up going with the less expensive brand now because if I have to replace it in 3 months anyway, might as well pay half the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was very excited when I made my purchase last month because I saw some good reviews and it was a good deal.. It looks like a lot of other customers are very satisfied with their product, sadly I`m very disappointed with mine and wouldn`t want to use it again after the smoke. I will definitely be looking into returning it.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Bought it for my classroom at Christmas time.  Never used, and then came Covid and school closure.  Return window closed already.  I ended up paying for a device that does not work.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an updated version of a laminator I had for years that jammed up on me (my fault) and was unable to remove the laminated sheet I was using it for at the time. I've only had this for a short while, but the initial tests seem to indicate that this is every bit as good as the original.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a preschool teacher.I have borrowed from other teachers different laminators, and this time I decided to buy mine.But both work well and do the job.I recommend it lots.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laminator was really great and convenient, and super easy to use. However after one year (and I only used it once or twice a month) it stopped working.","positive":1},{"review":"  SUPER easy to use and works perfectly. I was nervous because i`ve never laminated before but this machine made it so simple with amazing results.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this all the time love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laminates just fine but I often have a hard time getting the sheet to start feeding. There is a sweet spot you have to hit and it`s not always easy.I bought this because my old one was recalled, but I honestly like the non-pro version better.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's works great. The cord stores away inside and the top paper guide slides inside. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to do a decent amount of laminating. Very happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very easy to use, just plug in and wait for it to warm up. Works great to seal. We use it for home school. My only complaint is the fact that the cord is very short.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far I'm really liking this one. I have bought 3 or 4 (I've lost track -) at the local \"store\". With the other brand, I managed to get something stuck going through and could not recover it and just had to toss the things - agh. One time I had to use the anti-jam button, and it worked pretty well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have laminated several hundred pages and this thing works amazing. I use Scotch Thermal Laminating Pouches, 8.  I had another laminator before but this one is WAY better. Amazing product for the cost.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got it for half price, so I can`t complain much, but inserting the pouch can be difficult because of the hidden ridge that`s inside - blocks the pouch and you have to keep inserting it until you hit the sweet spot.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laminator was to be a Never Jam Technology and automatically prevents misfed items. First time I used it, it jammed. Very disappointed in this new laminator. Also doesn't seem to run as hot as others.","positive":0},{"review":"  I actually used it once. I laminated 10 sheets. Very disappointed . My window of return ended May 2 and today is June 4th.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a great little machine for laminating small things however I received the machine with wires sticking out the top where the paper to be laminated is inserted. I tired to tuck the wires in, but cannot. The machine works but wires should not be sticking out.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am very disappointed in this laminator. After reading several reviews and product endorsements on social media from fellow teachers, I thought this would be a perfect upgrade to my current laminator and was considering buying two separate ones - one to keep and home and one to keep in my classroom.

Of course, the return window has expired so I am out of luck and money.  Not happy.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this in September of 2019. Was very pleased with the performance.

This laminator worked wonderful for about 2 weeks, but while leaned against a wall it fell side ways onto a carpet floor, at which point it has never worked again.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had a different brand and left it on overnight.  It died.  I am a teacher, so I laminate a lot.  This one just doesn't cut it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laminator only has a 30-day warranty from the date of purchase.

I pulled it out of the box, plugged it in, turned it on and it was ready to go. Super easy to use. Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a basic laminator that does a good job. If you need a high output you may want to consider a more expensive unit. The rollers continue to spin anytime its turned on, so while its heating up they are spinning.Its small, effective and I like it for light use.","positive":1},{"review":"  Don't let this little guy fool you. It's Really held up VERY well. Still going strong since February, with a 30 day warranty. No Problems Here.","positive":1},{"review":"  For a number of years as a teacher, my wife constantly had to replace paper teaching aids. We looked at a bunch of reviews and bought the Scotch Pro. The reviews on Amazon were spot on and we're extremely satisfied with our purchase. Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really enjoy this product. Bought this model mostly because of the no jam. Works great and would highly recommend. Don't waste your money buying anything else because you will end up spending more when you lose plastic sheets and worse important documents.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this laminator with the pull out tray, to replace our other Scotch Laminator that kept jamming. I have utilized this laminator almost daily and have not had a single jam or malfunction. Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this at the beginning of the school year and three quarters through the year it's still working great. I've laminated, without exaggeration, over 500 items and it's worked beautifully. It's so much easier to laminate in my classroom than going up to the teacher workroom. Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  We use these at work where it's kept warm and ready 10 hours a day seven days a week laminating 50-100 credit card sized cards a week and yet they seem to consistently outlast laminators costing 2-3 times as much.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this product because it turns off by itself. I had another one similar and forgot to turn it off. I almost burn down the building. This one is amazing but difficult to load at times.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great compact size. Very easy to use.  Few minutes for warm up then away you go. I did multiple pages one after another with no issues.","positive":1},{"review":"  Worked exactly one time. Then it never powered on again.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have only lightly used this laminator.  I got it out tonight and it quit in the middle of the first sheet.  The light went out for no apparent reason and just quit working.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like this laminator, but i did not use it for long before it suddenly stopped working. Very disappointing that it didn`t last long.","positive":0},{"review":"  After using this laminator for a month, it overheated and now no longer will turn on. Wish i could return it as damaged but missed my window by 3 days. Oh the frustration. I would not recommend this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laminator stopped working after only a handful of uses. Very disappointing. Past return window so I seem to be stuck with it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was so looking forward to getting this because I have used a friends and it worked great. This is the second one I have ordered and it arrives not working properly. The second one would light up almost immediately that it was ready however it never warms up and still will not laminate. I have read multiple times to be careful not to drop it and I wonder if it gets dropped multiple times when shipping.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a teacher and use my laminator practically every day to laminate games and activities for my students.  My old Scotch laminator was great but had a recall.. DO NOT BUY.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I plug it in and leave it plugged in for a substainal period of time none of the bulbs light up. It will not feed the paper laminator packets through. My window for returning has expired, but I think I bought a warranty with it yet can not seem to find that on Amazon. I don`t know what to do and am out the money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had this laminator just shy of a year. Its started making a loud grinding sound and finally just stopped working as I was laminating a commission and I had to pull the piece out myself. This was my whole purpose for buying. I don't think that less than a year is a decent lifespan and now I have to buy a new one three days before a convention.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laminator worked great for about a month. The heat and sealing of the pouches were great until the last time the pieces wrapped around the roller. Could not pulled the pouch out.

If, however, it was a more expensive mouse ($30+) I would knock off at least one star.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to replace my corded version, which had gotten banged up over time and needed replacing.  I decided on the corded model previously so I never had to worry about a battery dying, or having any lag in mouse movement.  What I do like better with this model, other than the obvious wirelessness, is that is has a little extra weight to it (thanks to the AA battery I'm sure) and a heavier click to make it feel more substantial.  Hope this helps with your decision making.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you're anything like me you get this mouse, plug it in and go. You don't bother with the User Manual. But you know what. It's doing it's job.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great mouse for the price. 5 5 would buy again.If you are on a tight budget and want a sturdy mouse, go ahead and buy this.But, watch out if you have big hands or a left-hander though.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm comparing this to the logitech M705 that I've had at my desk for years. It is very, very similar in size and shape. There is a middle-button that clicks when you push the wheel down (just like the M705). The scroll wheel is \"faster\" and the bumps are \"shorter\" than the M705 if that makes any sense.","positive":1},{"review":"  UPDATE.

These days, if I moved my laptop to a different part of the house and forgot to grab the mouse, I will actually get up and go grab the mouse because I like it that much that I would rather walk and get it than to do without it. That itself is a testament to how much I like this mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  Disclaimer: This review focuses on the newer model, and how it fixed most of this models problems.The simple addition of the on off switch keeps the mouse from cutting off at random moments, due to this models sleep wake function. Additionally, I have larger hands, and these mice are pretty small, but the new model has a much better claw grip that makes it just a little more conformable to hold in my hand.Overall, the build quality is good, mouse works as expected and your probably not going to find a better wireless mouse for this price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Didn't fit my medium-sized hand very well. It was too low overall, and the sculpted right side actually slopes such that my fingers tended to slip off of it and I would have to frequently re-grasp it. 5-stars for their customer service and mouse pad.

The tactile feel of the back and forward buttons have improved as well as the squeak from the scroll wheel is gone now. Thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  Edit: Changed my review to 5 stars.  Even though I am long out of the warranty period for the product, the company reached out to me and apologized for my experience and QUICKLY sent me out a replacement.It is not a huge deal when I am just wasting time on the internet, but when I am working on something or teaching an online class it is absolutely infuriating. If I could go back in time I would have purchased a different one, but I am not entirely unhappy with this one.","positive":1},{"review":"  Even with all the DPI settings and trying to fine tune along with the windows mouse settings, I just couldn`t seem to dial this mouse in and get a steady hand on it. Maybe it was just me, I leave plenty of room for that, that it just wasn`t right for my fine motor control, but with the light weight and the lack of being able to grip along the right side of the mouse, I felt like it was almost always ready to squirt between my fingers.Thank you VicTsing and Thank you to Lotus for the excellent and persistent customer service. Well done.","positive":1},{"review":"  3 10 2018: I've gone from 2 stars to 5 with this. The company helped me completely fix the disconnection issue I was experiencing. It's irritating.

But so far, it's great. But those are minor flaws. For the price, this mouse is great.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a really nice mouse for the price, but straight to the point, its a mini, not a full size.Before ordering I read answers to questions about size, stating this is full size. however its not listed as a mini and now I cant use any of these I bought so its getting 4 stars for that reason solely.Hope I helped anyone who almost bought this thinking this was full size, and good luck on your search.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased two of these in April.

So far, I am loving it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This mouse hits all the markers of a super cheap mouse but the body feels solid, it's priced to match the overall cheap feeling, and seems usable for the time being.- It is almost a 'mini' mouse and feels almost awkwardly small even in my moderate-small hands, can't imagine larger hands using this comfortably.  It also seems like it would be difficult to use for children, the elderly, or the impaired because of the hard presses and rolls required.  If sound is an issue for you, the clicks are loud but the wheel is relatively quiet when going slow.","positive":0},{"review":"  EDIT: I've purchased this mouse twice now.

I'm very happy with this mouse, so I went to the trouble of looking carefully through all the Vic Tsing mice to find another of the same one.  You'll want to check out a different review if you're concerned about how it will fit in your hand and your hands are small or large.  The size of this one is basically that it occurs like a \"compact\" mouse for people with large hands, and like a \"full-size\" mouse for people with small hands.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can't live without my cordless mouse - touchpads, phooey. This mouse works well and fits the hand nicely, and the controls are natural and instinctive to anyone that's used a mouse before.The sensitivity level of a mouse should be set-and-forget, not something that needs doing EVERY TIME you wake it up. It becomes very tedious after awhile, and I probably would not buy this unit if I had it to do over.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my second non-bluetooth wireless mouse, purchased for use on my desktop computer.

A couple of things I noticed immediately was 1) the USB plug located on the underside of the mouse sticks out.

Ergonomically savvy - yes indeed.I guess the lesson learned here is, don't be afraid to speak up directly to the vendor, letting them know if you have a problem, giving them a chance to make things right before expressing one's dismay.I recommend this seller - they stand behind their products and go out of their way to make sure you're happy with your purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Drag was a little high for me, but then, I'm very touch sensitive.

For me, this one is fine. put the USB piece (it is stored it the mouse itself when you get it) in your computer, put a battery in your new mouse, give it a preliminary click, and you are good to go..","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this for an entry level gaming PC I built for my daughter. While this isn't a gaming mouse and possibly doesn't have a high enough polling rate and DPI levels for serious gamers, being able to adjust the DPI on the fly from this mouse is helpful and adequate for casual gaming. I've purchased VicTsing mice in the past and had trouble with one of them (bad scroll wheel), however that wasn't this mouse and they did replace it relatively quickly with a new one. I would recommend this mouse as it's comfortable to use, convenient back forward DPI buttons, it's wireless (decently responsive for gaming), inexpensive, and the company has good customer service in my experience.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just replaced a mouse that was starting to have lagging issues with this VicTsing Mouse, the old one was a Logitech mouse that apparently just didn't have the transmitting power necessary to keep a strong accurate connection.  Setup is superfast and easy, and I like the way you can easily click between dpi modes to change the sensitivity.  I am a professional photographer & use Photoshop and other editing programs constantly, and this mouse works fantastic for those tasks.  Just buy it, you won't be disappointed.","positive":1},{"review":"  UPDATE 2 16 2020: I had gotten used to the feel of the mouse and was satisfied somewhat. I still dont like the feel of the wheel. So far so good. Time will tell.","positive":0},{"review":"  My biggest frustration is the accuracy of the mouse. If you are just using it around a word document or the internet, it is nice. Not sure where to point a finger at the accuracy issue though. I like it, but it isn't exactly what I'm looking for.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't know how this mouse got so many good reviews.  Also,  I didn't think to search for \"scrolling\" in the reviews.I contacted the seller, and they sent me a new one.  I'll update this review after a few weeks.","positive":0},{"review":"  PROS:- The build quality is top-notch.- The mouse wheel has a pretty decent weight to it and a soft click while scrolling, which I like.- It is comfortable to hold, but pretty small. I have small hands myself and I would prefer a slightly larger area to hold.","positive":0},{"review":"  Man, I wish I could give less than one star. I am a really unhappy camper right now. I went ahead and upgraded to 3 stars. Will update if any other problems.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a little small for my wide hands and my full palm grip. My pinkie gets squished inward and I have to grip it differently than I usually do, more like a claw grip, but I'm adjusting. Maybe I got a dud and your luck will be better, but I can only speak for my experience. And that is that this is a piece of junk after two weeks.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was looking for a larger mouse that fit into my palm, not just my fingers - something like 5 x 3 x 1.75 (L x W x H).

Changing my review from 5 stars to 2, as this is quite annoying.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my Pi 4, to eliminate lots of extra wires. A wired mouse worked flawlessly, so I assumed a decent wireless mouse would be a simple switchover. This has caused hours of frustration while trying to uncover software bugs induced by spurious text. As a result I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DON`T BUY THIS MOUSE.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this based on the previous positive reviews for my work laptop when not docked in the office, which is usually just occasionally and I thought how bad could it be.  Due to COVID and working from home extensively, I used this mouse pretty much daily for about 2 months.  The M510 operates EXACTLY as you would expect it to.  Happy Mouser now.","positive":0},{"review":"  I picked the silver mouse because with the red button it looks like a Cylon from BSG.The first mouse I received did not work, tried it on multiple computers, and when I put in the usb the driver installed but the mouse didn't work. The mouse has a section on the bottom to store the little usb receiver when not in use, so no worries about losing that tiny, necessary piece.I also picked up the hard travel case for this mouse, and am very glad I did.","positive":1},{"review":"  UPDATE: I am updating my original review of this purchase.  I was contacted from the seller within a few days of my review, and received a sincere effort to make things right.  The reviews were good, so I thought I was buying a good product.

I work on computer all day but don't game anymore though wouldn't mind using this if I did for some games I might even prefer over the gaming mice I've used. Is smaller patches than my old mouse at first I thought it didn't slide as well because tiny plates the plastic wasn't visible, but then scratched with finger nail and sure enough was plastic covers, after slides like butter.USB stows on mouse so no get lost.","positive":1},{"review":"  So the thumb keys on the left feel nice, and depress easily. But they depress so easily that you can literally bump them by accident and it will literally close the web page you are viewing. It's the best mouse I've ever used, wired or not. I've never seen any surface cause it a problem yet, where my other Logitech mouse could barely work on the desk I have with simulated wood grain on it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this mouse to replace a more expensive Microsoft mobile mouse that recently died on me.. Definitely a value among \"value\" mice.Highly recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  My faithful old Logitech mouse was 6 years old, and I found out that was the reason my laptop starting going crazy, even after I tried changing the battery.  So this one had good reviews, especially for the price, so I thought why not..an excellent buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this mouse many years ago and it has been the best wireless moue or detail work.  I can't even tell you how long I have had it, but it has been a long time with much use since then.  I now have even more respect for this mouse since it was easily repairable without having to buy new parts.  I may even buy another as a spare.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this mouse for about two years now, I believe, and it has been accidentally dropped onto hardwood floors a few times from varying heights (the highest being about three and a half feet from the floor). I'm shocked to admit it never has broken.I plan to purchase their 2nd Wireless Mouse, as it looks really neat, and possibly that ergonomic one. This company is one I trust and I'm more than willing to buy their products.","positive":1},{"review":"  I want to like this mouse, but there are a few issues which lead me to probably returning it.1) It's big enough that you'd think that you could rest your palm on it, but then your fingers would be overlapping the button and you couldn't use the scroll wheel (and I don't even have big hands).Update: The company offered a free replacement, which I like better. So I'm bumping this up to 4 stars for the good customer service.","positive":1},{"review":"  This mouse is crazy comfortable for a righty. They added a ridge in the right side to separate your ring finger and pinky.Also you have to click it to wake it up instead of just moving the mouse. Not really a complaint, as it is handy if you don`t want to wake your computer up without clicking (like when you`re sleeping and your dog bumps your desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update: Excellent customer serviceWell I've had a couple of these mice now over the last 2 years. First one was decent, before my dog ate it: Fairly responsive sensor and buttons, good scrollwheel. I wouldn't buy them for anything that needs a good accurate mouse (gaming and such). Fine for scrolling the internet or general use.","positive":0},{"review":"  For the rice this typically mouse goes for, overall this is a great mouse, so long as it's working. Mine worked great ~90% of the time for about 2 years, with intermittent lagging every so often. 4)  Add an on off switch, and the sleep mode should wake once the mouse is moved, not clicked. Even after 2 years of use, I'll still find myself moving the mouse and confused why the cursor isn't moving, only to remember the feature, and then click with annoyance to wake the mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  it's cheap. It lasted a month. This is a real review. I'm seeing so many fake reviews and five stars on Amazon these days this site's reputation is tarnished.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received this in mid-January and it was perfect.. All-in-all, a good mouse, priced well, with a scrolling issue. JMHO, thanks for reading.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this for work in order to cut down on wires.  I'm used to a bigger, wired gaming mouse (a Razer DeathAdder Chroma) that I use at home.  I grabbed a gaming mousepad (Corsair MM300) that was less slick, and while it still doesn't track perfectly, it's way better than it was.  For $10, it serves my purpose, but don't expect it to be a very high quality mouse for this price.","positive":0},{"review":"  This works great until it doesn't, and the scroll starts being jerky, inconsistent, and starting by going up then goes down when you scroll down. If you look through the reviews you will see this is unfortunately quite common. Once again though, after a few months of use I am having the scroll issues again and can't keep putting up with this.One other thing - I'm not a fan of the back forward button placement, I keep accidentally hitting them and losing my current screen.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm going to start off by saying I have used the Logitech M510 for about 15 years and since you can no longer get the original anyway, I figured I'd give this VicTsing mouse a shot.  I mean 45k+ reviews can't be wrong, can they..  Maybe I'll get used to the small size, but I have a feeling this one is going back to Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  As a graphic designer, I need to make extremely small 1px movements with my mouse. It took me a long time to figure out why this mouse doesn't make it easy to make fine adjustments. I use it every day, and have done so for months, but never had to change the battery yet. So, it has stellar battery life.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I first bought this mouse it worked great. 2.Positive notes: The forward back buttons on the left side of the mouse are super handy, especially for web browsing and navigating folders. The mouse fits fairly well in my hand, though I'd like it maybe 10% larger so my pinky wouldn't rub on the table.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`ve never used an uncomfortable mouse before. I`ve had numerous mice, and I thought they were all pretty usable, even the nerdy stock ones that come with an HP. I just don`t get it. I`m plugging back in my cheesy HP wired mouse so I can get back to work.","positive":0},{"review":"  My original review is below, but after a few months, some additional observations:All of the buttons are quite sensitive. I find myself right-clicking just resting my finger on the button.  I actually like that it goes to sleep to save battery, and it wakes up immediately on pushing the button. My old mouse had to be shaken a bit to wake up.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a really good mouse especially for the price.  There are two negatives after using it for several months.  Maybe in their more expensive models you can program them.  I may purchase a more expensive variant as I am happy with the VicTsing brand.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice wireless mouse.  I'm using it on my desktop and it works just fine...","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm 37 and this is the best mouse I have used in my life. I work from home and suffer from terrible arthritis so I need something that would take the weight off using a macbook pro trackpad. We will see how it holds up. So far so good.","positive":1},{"review":"  This mouse controller is larger than the Amazon branded one I bought. It has a nice ergonomic feel to it. Click the other button and it brings you back to the current page. And, it has that little pocket underneath the device to store the dongle in.","positive":1},{"review":"  After having a mouse that wasn't ergo, I wondered how long it would take me to get used to this new mouse.  I would be lying if I said at first it felt a little awkward, but less than an hour later, I didn't even thing about it.  Is this is a big deal, absolutely not, it just took a little readjusting.  I would recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  First of all.. St. Louis, MO.","positive":1},{"review":"  This mouse works great.  I'd give it a five star but for one rather irritating problem. So you've got the two normal clickers on top on each side of the wheel and then this other one subtly placed but still jutting out on the left upper side.  I am constantly and inadvertently pressing this extra clicker accidentally brushing it with my thumb movement which closes out my current view, web page, etc and sometimes irrevocably losing my place on a site.","positive":1},{"review":"  The mouse was purchased for a new iMAC that I just got as I could not do a few things from the track pad (at least not that I have learned yet) So I wanted to get something that matched my pc and that was decent looking. I am very pleased with how the product works, the only one negative thing I can say about this mouse is that it is not that big in size and I am not a big tall person by any means. In fact I like the fact that I just have to click the mouse and it turns back on. Hope this helps anyone in need.","positive":1},{"review":"  Others have commented on the auto shutdown, but if you train yourself to hit the CPI button or wheel on the top whenever you grab the mouse, it jumps back to life very quickly.  I started by clicking to wake it up, but accidentally clicked on things I didn't want to if it hadn't gone to sleep yet.  I agree with the other enthusiastic reviewers. this mouse is great and I happily replaced my old Logitech one with this one.","positive":1},{"review":"  This mouse is horrible for gaming. It is very spotty with connection so the cursor doesn't move fluidly. I'm glad it didn't cost much because I can't return it as it's outside the return window. If all you're doing is web surfing this mouse is ok but even then it's annoying because the cursor doesn't move right away or stops moving for a second while trying to move across the page.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this same or similar product, same company--worked like a charm, has continued working-I got a 2nd remote job and bought a 2nd laptop for that job and wanted another mouse.

Over it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The ergonomic. shape might be comfortable for some, but the slant on the right makes it prone to dropping if not handled just right when picked up. I just thought THIS one would be nicer.I was wrong.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not a fan. I don't know if mine is defective or if they're all like this, but I cannot handle the jerky movement of this mouse. That might not sound like much, but it can make something as simple as clicking a box take several excruciating seconds more than it should. That irritation quickly adds up to an all around frustrating experience.","positive":0},{"review":"  I should have read more of the reviews before purchasing. I got mine and I was excited because it was really comfortable. Looking back through the reviews right now, I see that that is a very common problem. Honestly, go buy something else.","positive":0},{"review":"  I found this mouse unusable on a Windows 10 PC. When I tried to watch a movie - the mouse would automatically turn the volume down to zero. I would have simply returned this awful defective mouse but I became so frustrated with it that I threw it against the wall shattering it into dozens of pieces. That feeling that act engendered was probably worth the cost of the mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  To say I love this mouse would be to say I love those side buttons, and I don't.  Everything else about it has been great.  Junk.  And I guess I lost the money I spent.","positive":0},{"review":"  This mouse is very affordable, but I believe it was a waste of my money for the following reasons:1) It feels cheap and flimsy. It's not satisfying to use, and I worry that the two buttons will actually snap off. I literally had to buy a new mouse to replace my almost-new Mouse because I couldn't stand not having an extra port.Spend your money on a better Bluetooth mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  Responsiveness is perfect & ideal.  The size is simply too small to fit into the hand so the base of your hand can rest without having to fully support itself which gets tiring.  This Vic mouse, however, all the hand's weight is uncomfortably sitting on the lower outside palm due to the small size of the mouse.  Please consider this revision because the mouse's responsiveness is too good not to combine it with great ergonomics.","positive":0},{"review":"  [UPDATED REVIEW - 03 28 2019]The USB dongle used for the receiver for this mouse broke.  It came apart and now I cannot insert it into my USB port.  I have no issues since the receiver sits in the USB port right next to the mouse.I guess I'll find another mouse for my desktop PC.","positive":0},{"review":"  The mouse is alright, I odered two, one for my husband and myself. They work alright, being able to change the CPI is pretty cool.. let's add buttons that go back or forward through your internet history.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'll start by saying I already have (1) VicTsing mouse (side holding for wrist pain, works great btw).  I ordered this because I wanted a 6 button.. it's an upgrade from what I had previously.","positive":1},{"review":"  My biggest issue is the lack of an on off switch. As my mouse sits in my bookbag, every click will wake it from sleep to try and connect to the USB dongle. I honestly should have just coughed up the extra $10 for a high quality Logitech G602.Update, the seller offered to give me a replacement mouse that is much more acceptable.","positive":1},{"review":"  Listen, I treated my old mouse, this exact model..Either way, I'm happy w  the previous purchase and with this purchase.  Sometimes we expect a bit too much out of things but I truly got my money's worth last time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have the same mouse in a wired version, and love it. Due to suddenly needing to utilize Zoom and other video conferencing apps, I wanted to use my TV as a second monitor and needed a wireless mouse so I could operate it from in front of my TV.The Wired one I have had for almost 4 years, still going strong like the day I first bought it, only have the wireless for the mobility. And after my first full week with this one, I expect to see the same quality and longevity.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an excellent mouse. It's easy to click no matter where you place your finger, it's surprisingly comfortable, and the side buttons are very responsive and useful even with everyday web surfing. But it's definitely not a deal breaker.9.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed this wireless mouse for an online class. My leg is broken so I'm casting to my tv & needed a wireless mouse & keyboard, so I could sit on couch with leg elevated.  I am used to my wired gaming mouse that I like very much by Corsair. Note: there is no tilt on the wheel for side to side motion or scrolling, if that is what you might be used to as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this mouse with a little fear it wouldn't be worth it, but I've been very happy with the little thing.  It connected quickly to the PC using the dongle it came with and has been performing flawlessly ever since.  Other than that period of adjustment, I have had zero problem with the mouse and have been very pleased with it.  Good deal for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall this was a good mouse for the money for about a year.I liked that it had an ergonomic feel, the mouse glided pretty smoothly, and with very few connectivity issues.Pros:-Better than most cheap mice I've used-Ergonomic feel (my wrists did not hurt after many hours of use, like they usually do with other mice)-Smooth glide-Few connectivity issues-Has a port underneath to store wireless usb connector (so don't lose it when traveling)-Works well with Mac (some mice claim to work with Mac, but actually do not)Cons:-The rubber grip on the side fell off within a month (but I just wiped off the glue and it felt pretty much the same without it)-The bottom of the mouse somehow attracts dirt and other gunk, so you have to constantly wipe off the bottom or else the mouse doesn't glide well-After a year it's not gliding as well and feels like time for a new mouse (on the plus side, it's so cheap that even if I bought one every year it would be the equivalent to buying a real Apple mouse every 6 years).","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn't expect much from this , as I just need some wireless mouse for my hp laptop. As soon as I received the package(quick delivery)...","positive":1},{"review":"  I'll start off with what I like. I do like the sleep mode where it'll sleep automatically and then you can just click to wake it up. It's cheap laser hardware, spend a few bucks more and get a better mouse. The only reason I was buying a new mouse to start with was my mouse I've had a long while had it's clicking switch going out and it was easier just to buy a new mouse, it's for a laptop, but right away I could tell that mouse had something wrong with it's precision, and when I started testing the ability to move the mouse without it registering any movement, I knew I had to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a good mouse, especially for the price. There are three main issues that prevent me from loving it:1. Now it regularly scrolls in the opposite direction for a bit, making scrolling nearly impossible. Going to attempt an exchange.","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all.. For the price, I guess I can't really complain, but the Logitech mouse I had prior to this mouse, worked heads and hands above this device. Unfortunately, the Logitech mouse scroll wheel stopped functioning after years of use and needed to be replaced because I'm a big scroll wheel user, but I kept it as a backup.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was a great deal for a mouse and I really like the design and how there is an onboard storage spot for the transceiver.  I purchased 2 of these to use when setting up my home office.  So far the second mouse is still working fine so I guess I just got a bad one.  I guess I'll just go back to a cabled mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  I hated this mouse for months on a computer I occasionally use.  Now I'm using this computer more frequently.  Had to use my other crappy wireless mouse for now that works.  Sad.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to replace a logitech M187 micro-mouse because this mouse was advertised as a \"laptop\" mouse. The M187 is small and goes well with my little, trusty Asus Eee PC that's really a little gem of a laptop having all the features I need for a small portable PC. I guess that's an ergonomic issue such that the slippery feel made me want to try to grip the mouse harder which caused my hand to cramp up.It's going back and I will order a M187 just to get the little receiver.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this mouse as a last ditch effort to replace another mouse for cheap.For 10 bucks this mouse is okay, the cursor sensitivity works fine aside from the mouse not detecting hand movement - despite me moving the mouse on a Victsing mousepad - at times.3 5 stars. If you're strapped for cash this MIGHT be for you, but if you can spend more money give this a pass for something higher quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was excited to find this item at the price. After reading the reviews I was very hopeful. Because of that the tracking is frustrating and feels like the mouse is working against me. I would never use this to game if that is what you are considering purchasing this for your gaming rig.","positive":0},{"review":"  I connected this to my old Mac Book Air and it works fine. I have no issues with the sensor, weight, or materials. I'm not even sure if I want to keep using this. Also, batteries are not included (as stated in the product description).","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this as a replacement for my Logitech M510 after it's middle click wheel stopped working consistently. I picked this one because of the reviews and the price.2) It takes around 5 seconds for it to wake up each morning, it's not instantaneous like other mice I've used.I shouldn't have tried to save the $12 and should have just gotten another M510 again, which is what I ended up doing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have purchased 3 of this item. I thought it might feel bulky...","positive":1},{"review":"  This is such a great mouse. Although it isn't the size of a \"full-sized mouse\", it is still very economical.

Overall it's a good mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  My old Logitech wireless mouse broke after a drop, so based on reading some reviews decided to go this this item as a low-cost alternative. I am pleased with the comfort and performance so far, and it already survived a drop. You will also need a pad if using on a glossy glass surface, but that is common with most mice.

And my family is happy, because they don't hear me cursing at my Apple mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far, so good. I killed the fly wheel on my last mouse, that is what I use the most other than left click. Also it is purple, which ties in with my aesthetic even if it means defending the mouse from the kids. This also looks harder to gum up than my last mouse, which is good.","positive":1},{"review":"  Mouse is great and I won't even say \"for the money\". Well built with real rubber at the thumb. Just wish it was more reassuring so as to assuage my concern for it possibly falling out and getting lost. Bottomline, though, is that I am very pleased with it and don't see any need to spend more money on a bigger name brand.","positive":1},{"review":"  In terms of core pointing-and-clicking functionality, this mouse has served flawlessly. The rest of the review will dwell on the negatives, but don't forget that.DPI control is a nice feature, but unlike some other gaming mice the DPI settings only cycle in one direction. So it's suitable for setting your preferred precision, either permanently or for a particular session, but less so for dynamically changing precision in real time.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ergonomic, tactile, and well built. The M4 and M5 buttons on the left side are well placed for right handed users and both can be easily accesed with any part of the thumb. Overall, as far as I know, this is the best right handed mouse, in it's price range, available on Amazon. AA Battery not included.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update:TL. DR: the wireless receivers seem to conflict if you have more than one. Most mice force my hand to splay awkwardly, but I'm having to adjust my grip to bring my ring and pinky fingers in to the finger rest on the side, which I'm happy to do. For reference, my hand is 3\" wide across the knuckles, and 7\" from middle finger to base of palm.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not much to say about the VicTsing MM057 2.4G Wireless. You can easily replace this mouse if you have any issues with it. However, that is an inconvenience and like many tech products, the integrity of the craftsmanship still matters.","positive":0},{"review":"  On a smaller size but still large enough not only for travel but also for office workUSB receiver is sticking out on the bottom so the mouse will not stay flat on the table once it is insertedBattery is difficult to remove once insertedScrolling wheel clicking is not consistent so scrolling on web pages and documents is jumpySide rubber silicone pad not glued well and the corner was peeling off.Mouse button clicks are quieter than on my Logitech Masters but not as quiet as on Microsoft Surface Mobile Mouse or Logitech Pebble M350Overall, assuming my scroll wheel is defective, this mouse is good enough as backup travel mouse but I think it should not cost 1 2 the asking price for the quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  The VicTsing mouse doesn't register when you're moving it very slowly. If you just want to move the mouse a tiny bit, you're probably used to just nudging it a tiny bit in that direction.The mouse itself actually works and has the advertised features, so I'll give it 2 stars. But this defect is significant enough that I went back to using my old mouse with no DPI settings and no extra buttons.","positive":0},{"review":"  Update:Great customer service tho. I was a big fan of the original mouse that I purchased, but they followed up with me and sent me a new one that I actually enjoy. If you want it for office functions, this is not your type. If you just want something wireless, go for it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was originally going to buy a standard brand mouse (eg. Logitech) but then came across this VicTsing mouse. In this case, you get what you pay for. Save yourself the frustration, cough up the dough upfront, and get a good quality mouse instead.","positive":0},{"review":"  I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone. The mouse \"feels\" okay, but it has a major issue, the scroll wheel jumps around a lot. In short, it is likely a poor quality sensor. If you are thinking about using this mouse for gaming, or anything other than basic web browsing, definitely do NOT get this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  This mouse was worth a try for me at the price, but once again I fell for it.

The company does not support deactivating the button unfortunately so I'll be looking for a different mouse and putting this in the backup drawer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Used it for a few hours, played some fps games and  scrolled around the internet to get a feel for it.PROS:-setup is super easy, plug it in and go.-(insignificant to some people) no rgb or other lighting.All in all, it's a good little mouse for the average user, but for the more advanced user or gamer you'd be better off spending a bit more money and getting one with more features.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have not owned a wireless mouse or keyboard for 12 years now.  My experiences in the past have led me to avoid them like the plague. I really like the fact that the mouse goes to sleep when it's not being used, and it wakes up very easily. This has nothing to do with the wireless dinosaur I had many many years ago, I would actually like to buy a couple more of these for my PC's now.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall a decent mouse. Pretty good for gaming.  Since I like the ergonomics of the mouse, I accepted. (Even though the scroll wheel wasn't working well, I was still using the mouse with games.","positive":1},{"review":"  Once I finely figured out how to use it. There is an instruction paragraph but the print is so small even my 8yo granddaughter wouldn't be able to read it. I have small hands so might not be comfortable for a large hand person. For the price it's nice.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update:  Manufacturer got in touch with me and sent a replacement.  I will update this review if my first one was just an anomaly.Yeah, it's under $10, but should work longer than that.I would not buy it again and will not recommend it to anyone I know.","positive":1},{"review":"  This mouse is not perfect, but it's close enough and more than worth the $10 I paid for it. I've been using it for about a month now and have had no issues so far. Some other reviews mention other issues that I haven't experienced, but even if I did, I would still rate five stars because it's worth it for the price. There are better and more expensive options, but I would definitely consider this one.","positive":1},{"review":"  The mouse is great and I enjoyed its ergonomic design. I've had it for about a year now and it was working amazingly, honestly.EDIT: reached out to the company and they sent me a brand new one, no question asked and I  didnt even have to wait an absurd time on hold. That's what I call great custtomer service.","positive":1},{"review":"  Me being dumb thought I could fix it and nothing happened. The button where you see the red turn on was slightly pushed in and figure that is what caused it to stop moving.2020 VicTsing was really nice enough to help send a replacement with out question and was good about looking for feed back. So far the newer model I have is working good.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great wireless mouse that feels smoothe. There are 3 things I like the most.99 or lower then it deserves a 5 star rating. But for this price, 4 stars is plenty.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had this mouse for roughly a year, and it worked like a wonder at first. I didn't cared for the lacking of on off button since it was mainly for my desktop pc, but I can see how it might be a problem if you plan to carry this mouse in your bag. Please know that this is also happening to other people, so I definitely don't think it's just a bad batch or something. There might be some design flaws or whatever, but really couldn't recommend anyone buying this.","positive":0},{"review":"  I first purchased this mouse in January of 2020. The mouse worked GREAT. Plugged in my 20 year old USB mouse on a wire, which I still have at least 2  more just in case. Old technology never dies, it just grows old with me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my wife. This is her feedback. She also says she loses connectivity with it sometimes, which was not a problem with the one it replaced. So overall, for the price, not bad, but it leaves something to be desired.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ok, the good: product looks good, it is comfortable to use for long periods of time  and the motion sensor works well. The DPI sensitivity button is a nice feature that works well for the few times you might actually need it. 1 or 2 extra buttons on the side of the mouse would also be a nice extra feature too.Overall, this mouse did not live up to even my most modest expectations for work, and it will now be relegated to emergency use only.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this mouse for a few weeks now.  I love the feel of the mouse - fits nicely in my hand.  Also, don't think you didn't get all the pieces to make this mouse work when you don't see the USB connector.  You will find that on the under-pinion of the mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a good mouse at a good price ($11.00). I REALLY like the fact that it goes to sleep after 8 minutes thereby conserving battery life. Overall a nice little mouse for basic internet browsing and office tasks, but I think I'll give this one to my wife and keep looking.","positive":0},{"review":"  So I've gone from 4 Stars to 1 Star. And its very reasonable why. Tragic, considering how much I love the mouse. I might try to remove the pad, fully clean the paste, and then replace with superglue.","positive":0},{"review":"  I decided to try out this mouse after a failure of a name brand $70 gaming mouse. I like the feel of it, and this mouse is really easy on the batteries.  Great mouse overall, but replacing it 2-3 times per year due to buttons going out is starting to get annoying. I don't think I'll be buying another one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this mouse because my old one was too small and drained batteries too fast.The pros:It's a decent size. A good mouse for me would be one I'd never have to think about and this one is a burden you cannot ignore for long. I replaced it recently and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","positive":0},{"review":"  Maybe I am doing something wrong or it is defective, I bought a new Windows 10 laptop about 10 days ago, my other mouse was a Logitech M600 and apparently is not a great compatibility with my new laptop, so I decided to look for something else. I could buy something else but the reviews got me to buy this VicTsing MM057. It is very slow and I do not play games, simply browsing and doing my work, I replaced the battery again, thinking that was the problem, but still the same.If I am doing something wrong, please let me know on the comments in order for me to fix the issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s a little smaller than most computer mice but perfect for my daughter since her hands are small. Feels very lightweight cheap but the rubber inner grip part where the buttons on the side are is nice. crunchy. Response time is good and set up is easy.","positive":1},{"review":"  As much as I was doubting it.  This mouse proved me wrong.  I have had more robust mice, but you are looking at $60-$60.  Definitely worth and exceeded value for price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This mouse was very easy to set up and with the help of the third-party mouse configuration software X-mouse, I was able to use this mouse effectively and efficiently. The design of the mouse almost perfectly fit my hands.Also a note for the user: there are small pieces of plastic under the mouse that you could take off for the smoothest effect.I am very satisfied with this product, and I will most certainly look into more products.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update: 12 25 16: After working with this mouse for a few weeks, I can report that I really like the mouse I received after I wrote my initial critical review (see below), with one notable exception: my thumb keeps hitting the \"back\" button on the mouse accidentally. As you can see in my pictures, the mouse has two long rectangular buttons just above the area where you rest your thumb.Original review: The mouse I received had poor latency, causing a delay and making it almost impossible to use. Returned for refund.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use a portable mouse at work to avoid having to use the rather fussy touchpad mouse on my laptop while I'm away from my desk, either for attending meetings or making presentations.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my 2nd mouse from this brand. I have a wired one for gaming, and I wanted a wireless one for work (my company only uses bulk Dell mice that come with the desktop PCs regardless of how limited their function) and the little cheapy one I got died pretty much within 3 months.  It fit my hand perfectly, it's smooth to work with ( I don't use a mouse pad), buttons have great tactile feedback, and the rose gold color is more of a bronze. Overall a very nice mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  Edit 2: Mouse lasted 16 months on 1xAA battery, and I'm sure it would have lasted longer if I wasn't home on quarantine using it much more often than normal. Definitely happy with that battery life. I'm using the mouse with OS X so after finding a program to re-map mouse buttons, it works great in OS X. One interesting thing: The mouse doesn't have a visible laser.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this mouse as a back up for my hard wired mouse on my lap top.  It has ended up being my tablet wireless mouse of choice and my older wireless mouse has become my back up. Simply install one AA alkaline battery (not furnished) and install the USB receiver into an open USB port. In seconds both my lap top and tablet were programed to function with this mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  My mouse just stopped working and I needed a new one quickly. My instinct was to go to a recognized name which was Logitech. Although this is taking me some time to get used to, I see its benefit to energy savings, If you are looking for a new mouse to basic tasks, I highly recommend this one. I'm not a gamer, I have nothing to say in that regard.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am an ammature esports competitior. I play and sometimes test a wide range of games, and when my old razor mouse broke but I was on a budget I grabbed this one thinking it would be a temp mouse for a month or two. Its sturdy, accurate aiming, smooth program transitioning so no need to configure every other game to adjust its speed.  Its auto sleep feature is far better than having to remember to turn the mouse on and off, and is by far my favorite feature and has already been saving me battery life ask I like to test mine before gaming for the day to see if I need to put new ones in, and keep the mostly dead ones for facebook scrolling.","positive":1},{"review":"  Updating this review - in less than 6 months the adhesive has completely failed on the left side thumb pad. Now the pad falls off several times throughout the day and leaves my fingers sticky. Sleep mode works well, it powers down after some time of inactivity to save battery and powers back up at the click of a button without delay. Perfect choice for a basic wireless mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  A typical wireless mouse that is nicely contoured an fits in the palm of your hand. Does all those mousy things the others do. There's no real control except to be very cognizant of where your fingers are on the mouse at all times. Not sure if it's worth the hassle to keep using it.","positive":0},{"review":"  So at first the mouse was great. Super comfortable, ergonomic, and just as advertised. The thumb pad has completely come off and now I am left with just the forward back buttons as an extra feature. Super disappointing and just after a few months I have to get a new mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  The \"battery-saving feature\" that this mouse has may be fine on a desk, but it's its own downfall when used in a backpack. Whereas a mouse with a power switch may last an entire year on one battery, this mouse constantly turns itself on whenever I move my backpack slightly, wasting power. It's red. It's not nearly as cool-looking as the product page makes it seem.","positive":0},{"review":"  Latest Update. I contacted VicTsing regarding my problem and they promptly sent me a replacement. An on off switch would be nice but I don't really use one when I have it.All in all, for the price it is a very good mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this mouse specifically for the added side button functionality, because I use a mouse like this at work and the side buttons are SO useful for going back forward. However, if you read through the entire description of this mouse, you'll see they snuck this in at the very bottom:\"Notice,the side buttons are not available for Mac OS,but the other function can be used normally. Just google: SensibleSideButtons and voila your side buttons will work, no setup required. Thank you SensibleSideButtons man, you're my hero.","positive":0},{"review":"  The mouse is really comfortable.  I like that.  My old freebie mouse lasted about a year on each battery.  This sleep mode solves a non-existent problem.","positive":0},{"review":"  How can this have 60,000 mostly positive reviews.We've all used a mouse before, right.It might be good for a preteen, but I'd be afraid it's issue is still there and my kid would never learn to use a mouse well.Great price, it even looks good, but if you need any degree of precision it's just not usable.","positive":0},{"review":"  We were looking for a cheap alternative to the excellent Logitech M705 mouse to sell to our customers. (We're a small computer company. I suppose it's still a pretty good value at the price, but we're just not going to sell such a product to our customers. I'm really surprised that VicTsing couldn't get this basic feature right.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this mouse to use at my office desk for work. It worked fine for the first 4-5 months but then started to fall apart on me. Battery life is great and sleep mode keeps really helps with longevity. I've only replaced the battery once about 4 months in and I use this mouse daily.","positive":0},{"review":"  From my research, the vast majority of these \"all-in-one\" radio charger flashlight emergency crank solar alkaline-option crank radios appear to have the same basic chinese made guts, but with different cases, buttons, and logos.  Even USA branded emergency radios do not advertise \"Made in USA\", so one can reasonably presume that even they probably are using the same chinese-made guts (although, they may have prettier cases and name-brand LED lights).  In a survival situation, you want simple, yet functional.This does the job.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this radio to add to my \"hurricane\" kit here in Texas and I must say that it's much better than I expected it to be.Build quality is decent but I was impressed with the built in chargeable battery (by micro usb or manual winding) and the sound quality volume. The light is fairly bright and it's pretty easy to wind up. It's also fairly compact - see attached picture in my hand for an idea of it's size.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0Everyone should have one of these in their car. Seriously. The lights are bright and will last for quite a while. Everything seems water tight, but I have not tested it in the water.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this just Incase for an upcoming earthquake in California.","positive":1},{"review":"  To begin I hardly ever write reviews. Why. But It's a good radio for just everyday use. I may even, buy another.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Emergency Solar Hand Crank Radio is portable and very handy during power outages. The radio is clear and audible. Also, you can charge your phone with the included portable usb cable. Definitely a great item to add to survival backpack, keep in car, and at home for emergencies.","positive":1},{"review":"  Powered by external batteries or internal Li, this radio also is solar rechargeable and features not only an adjustable standing lamp but also a spotlight. The lights work great, as do the radio and charging features. Clear NOAA signal and radio bands, LOUD emergency signal. Well worth the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  First of all, I leave in the Caribbean, so having a portable radio is super important for emergencies during hurricane season because we do get a lot of power outages. Having a radio is the way to stay on top of what is going on and of course listening to some music to entertain the mind while there is no power. We recently were without power for two days and it was amazing having it handy. Would recommend and would buy more as gift to family that live here on the island as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s fine as an emergency radio. Solar battery works. If your want channel preselect options, better sound, battery power level left in device this is not the one. But if you need a just in case emergency radio that has a power crank, solar battery or regular store bought battery options this will do the trick.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall a good product for the price. You have several sources of power between: solar, battery, crank charger and internal power bank. It has an alarm too, for in case of emergency. Will help if we flood to get attention as it`s loud enough.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything works perfectly and it's such a cool little device. Can be charged with batteries, solar, usb, or hand crank. If I had known I wouldn't be able to charge my phone, I would have purchased another product. I'm not sure if mine had a defect or something, but it seems like a weird flaw in the product since USB ports are standardized.","positive":0},{"review":"  tired charging it with the solar panel and the hand crank. Light never worked at all and could not get even one radio channel. We did not return the item due to throwing out the boxes it came in originally.","positive":0},{"review":"  Way too too small, I returned immediately.  Didn't use.  I want one that's larger.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very disappointed, I bought three as Xmas gifts. I have one similar that I love and the radio is really awesome, we take it to the beach which is great for the solar feature. This product is cheap, the radio doesn`t have good reception. I am ver disappointing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I decided to use the radio to be sure that It would do the trick in an emergency.  The radio worked for approximately 4 hrs two nites in a row on the solar lithium battery after being fully charged then another 8 hours maybe on the 3 triple a batteries I installed.  In  an emergency this is serious matter if you think you have at least radio communication but in fact you don't.  So sad really to sell something like this, very untrustworthy.","positive":0},{"review":"  A piece of junk.  None of the radio options works on any of the power options, the controls are unusuable.  UPDATE:  Seller said he will refund, and it was not necessary to return item.  Addled a star for that.","positive":0},{"review":"  We live about 30 miles from a major city, so perhaps people closer to a city and radio stations do better.  Most functions work fine (lights, etc) and FM stations are pretty strong.  If you're in the boonies at all and just want lights, siren, lights and FM, fine.  Otherwise be prepared for Weather and AM to be unavailable.","positive":0},{"review":"  Charged first time and then won`t charge again.","positive":0},{"review":"  After using this occasionally as an outdoor radio for a few months, the built in lithium ion battery had trouble holding a charge.  I could leave it in the sun for a long time or crank it for several minutes, but then it loses the charge after just a few minutes.On the plus side, it is designed to use AAA batteries too, so we can still use all of the features.  It's nice to have the emergency radio band and a spare flashlight.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was so tiny and felt like a toy. Such a disappointment for the price. DO NOT BUY.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this radio primarily for the cell phone charging feature, which my old emergency radio lacked. And a USB cord that fits my cell phone was included. Warning:  'AL' stand for alarm (loud). Overall, very please with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pretty good for the price. AM FM and weather radio all work well. Build quality isn`t the highest but good deal for the price. I would recommend this as a backup or buy more than one.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just arrived. Here's what I liked about the product. I don't like the quality of the buttons for the twisting knobs feel really cheaply made. Will test the battery life and how charged is my cell phone soon stay tuned.","positive":1},{"review":"  I only have about a days experience of using this radio and so far, I am pleased with it. It`s light and compact enough for my emergency bag and comes with a lot of features. It is a plastic material and I can definitely visualize it snapping in the future under rigorous use. Subbing that material out for metal or a more corrosion resistant material would make this perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  All things considered, I really like this little device. It has good sound for what it is. Everything works well and the design is efficient. I wish I had this when my power got knocked out by a storm a few weeks ago.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this product to add to my emergency kit, and I love how versatile this is. Theres so many ways to keep the radio powered at all times, no matter what. The only thing that might have an issue in the long run is the antenna seems very fragile when you need to use it. Also I would use the hand crank as a last resort as that might seem it could break if used very often and quickly.","positive":1},{"review":"  Luckily we have not encountered an emergency situation where this radio flashlight has been essential but that has not stopped us from enjoying it.  It is smaller than I thought it would be, it is about the size of my hand, which is perfect because that makes it easy to hold on to and move around.  Throughout the day we will keep the radio playing, it is perfect to listen to while doing dishes or other things, especially when you have kids sleeping in the other room because it is not too loud.  We love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It was smaller than I expected it to be, but for the emergency kit, it's the perfect size. The radio works well with the pulled out antenna. Left it to charge using the micro-usb cable that was provided, and it didn't take to long to charge. I tested everything out again to make sure before putting it in the emergency kit, and all is good and dandy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just love how compact it is, and how many ways of charging it has. Perfect for camping or for an emergency or evacuation where sometimes you don't have batteries or electricity to charge it. It is really useful.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased as hurricane emergency radio.Likes: small and compact, good radio, good lights, triple-a batts will power radio.Dislikes: charging cord is 6cm long, if raising the solar panel to adjust for sunlight a white flashlight comes on.","positive":1},{"review":"  The hand crank handle snapped off fairly quickly. A nice feature but not really built for use.Basically I would highly recommend for an emergency earthquake pack. I purchased with intent for regular daily use and was disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  So at first glance this was a great unit, it worked decently upon arrival, however within 2 weeks of use (using the radio once a week and testing the battery life with radio and lights) it performed decently, until I tried plugging my phone in and it wouldn`t charge at all, and even though the instructions say it won`t operate on am when charging it actually wont operate anything other than lights when you have a phone or headlamp plugged in to recharge...","positive":0},{"review":"  This was smaller than I thought and the knobs were small so I returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  SAVE YOURMONEY.","positive":0},{"review":"  The hand crank was difficult to use, the solar power did not work for me, and the batteries drained in a short while. I returned the emergency radio.","positive":0},{"review":"  Total JUNK & can't return now. I put brand new batteries in & only works once, then stops. Totally useless. I didn't try the solar panel.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a pretty good product, but one of the main reasons I bought it was that it was said to charge phones. The plug-in part of the little black cable they provided did not fit into my iPhone (and yes, I tried both directions). Maybe it's because I have a relatively old iPhone - a 5E.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the quality of sound I got from radio frequencies (even though I have not yet used it in the country), it's easy to use and I like that it has both a flashlight and a flexible reading light. The volume of the alarm is not bad and the texture of the radio is a bit rubbery which I like. The solar panel charging also hasn't done much for me but it's been cloudy and rainy where I am so it might just be lack of solar polar availability. It has only truly worked so far with AAA batteries.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is good to have as an alternative powered radio, but as a NOAA alert radio .. This will NOT tell you if a storm is coming unless you happen to have it on and switch to the weather band when the storm happens to arrive. If you're looking for an early warning weather radio, this is not it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was much smaller than the one I have.  For $10 dollars more, I could have gotten much better quality.  The sound was too quiet and because it was small it was harder to see the dials.  I don't yet know about the battery life but it has a crank handle for that so I am sure that will be fine.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got one of these for my household last winter, then got another for my father-in-law. Both our households have been pleased with this little weather radio. Just charged it up on a USB port and am really glad to have it in our storm equipment. Strongly recommend this.","positive":1},{"review":"  This this is so cool. I set it in the sun for about an hour while doing house work, then came back to explore its features. So happy to have this just in case of emergency. I haven't tested how long the battery life is but as long as you have sun light or can crank it, you'll always have light  power.","positive":1},{"review":"  This radio is medium in size and is perfect for my first aid kit. It comes in handy when I go out for outdoor activities. I also bought a small battery-powered radio and flashlight just in case. It is best to over-prepare rather than under-prepare.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been wanting to get this product as I consider it essential in the area where I live, I was searching And saw several different options until I came across this one. I`m glad I did as it is very easy to use, the battery is very efficient and has 4 power sources. I was able to get it going with a couple of hand cranks only. Good purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I opened the box and turned it on and nothing. I charged it overnight and nothing. Great sound and very bright light. Great value.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this radio for bug out bag.Have tested it several times.  Weather band comes in loud and clear.Bonus features like flashlight, reading light and usb port work every well.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to add to our emergency supply kit. One never knows what the future holds so wanted to be ready. I think this is going to be great to have to charge our phones, provide light, and information when or if the time comes. Very happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  We bought this for emergencies after we had a bad power outage. It fits right in your hand and works great. Most are just solar and if the weather is really bad then once that's out that's it. Quality is very good and would recommend this for anyone camping or for emergency supply.","positive":1},{"review":"  In addition to the many features listed in the product description, real aerobic and forearm workouts are provided when utilizing the hand crank to charge the included Li-ion battery. The FM, AM, and weather radio bands all received strong signals, and though the sound quality was not hi-fi, it was clear and static-free. This compact (see photo) device is lightweight, and the materials and workmanship appear to be quite serviceable, although it is recommended that it be stored in a soft bag to protect the flashlight lens, radio dial, and solar panel. Will likely prove invaluable during unanticipated power outages.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed this for those emergency moments when the sirens go off in stormy season when TV is out and I need weather updates.

Plus it is not very comfortable to turn the crank.","positive":0},{"review":"  I haven't used the product yet. But I can tell you that this looks very cheaply made. I feel like if I drop it the thing is going to completely bust or break.

But that is not the case, it was returned.","positive":0},{"review":"  Well don`t expect a large size item. This thing is very small for the price they charge. Disappointed for that reason..","positive":0},{"review":"  The radio doesn`t play at all, the instructions are gibberish so it`s impossible to figure out what`s wrong, and there`s no contact information for the manufacturer. $33 is a lot to pay for what is essentially a bulky flashlight. This is garbage, not emergency equipment, and lord help anyone forced to rely on it in a crisis. Shame on the merchant for selling this crap.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great sound for a little radio. Good to have multiple options to power by battery,  crank, solar, etc. going in kit for power outages. Too bad the USB port isn't glued in better  - can no longer charge the internal battery after less than a year of very little use.","positive":0},{"review":"  With the wicked Hurricane seasons in recent history, I sent these radios to my favorite people.These units are so versatile.They're small and compact with many power options: battery, solar and hand crank.Great for emergencies.","positive":1},{"review":"  do not know how it works at a time when I need it I will know more this summer when they turn off the power again  off my power for days and have lived here for over 40 years and have not seen any fires even close but there are power lines close and I guess they are not maintained well and might break like the ones in Northern and southern California.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little radio *may* save our lives one day.

Hopefully, we will never need to find out how well it performs with long term day to day use but I believe it will work well if needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am pleased with the emergency solar radio.The lights (the spotlight at the end of the device and the light located on the underside of the solar panel) put out sufficient light. The NOAA Weather station comes in clear . Overall, for the price, I am glad that I purchased this device.","positive":1},{"review":"  I tried this radio out as soon as I got it, to make sure it worked, since it is going in our emergency go bag.  I haven't checked to see if it is water resistant, but it when I wound it up it worked great.  We were able to pick up the emergency stations, and the reading light was plenty bright.","positive":1},{"review":"  My sister love this radio. You just crank it and it works awesome. It has 2 lights. I'm looking to buy a 3rd one soon.","positive":1},{"review":"  The metal collar which receives the USB into the side of this unit to recharge it has somehow come loose and falling into the device. As the solar panel is pretty much useless, and no amount of hand cranking gives this radio enough charge to let you forget about it for a while, the missing receiving piece means it`s pretty much useless. Amazon won`t give me the option to return it as I am out of the return window, but I paid nearly $50 for this thing so it`s pretty frustrating.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this item during the Oklahoma ice storm power outage to charge phones but it is not able to do so. It connects to a USB cable, but it does not hold enough charge through solar power nor does it make it easy to consistently crank and charge. The radio and lights work well and it does give the option of lithium battery and AAA batteries.TL:DR Great lights and good radio, but horrible phone charger.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this radio at the beginning of May, used it a couple of times then to test it, and then tried it again yesterday, only to find out the radio no longer works. The flashlight does, but since the main purpose is to be a weather radio alert system, having a broken radio defeats the purpose. Don't buy this piece of junk.","positive":0},{"review":"  The crank is really small sho your hand will slip a lot.","positive":0},{"review":"  The usb charging port got pushed inside the radio the 1st time that I tried to charge it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Definitely poor speaker quality. Not for audiophiles that's for sure. Durable. Lasts quite a while on full charge.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not very good quality.  The radio receiver is too small for decent reception.  This has nothing to do with the seller, who performed as expected.","positive":0},{"review":"  Wasn't able to charge phone, drained phone and took over the power to charge itself.Was hard to hear sound of weather and light was not bright enough. Small flashlight was brighter.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a good choice for a cheap emergency radio. Audio quality is not the best, but it got us through a 5 day power outage. Haven`t tried charging my iPhone on it yet.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is very very small.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was surprised at the small size, but it's solid and feels well constructed.  Easily picked up stations on all bands, and every function worked.  The LED's are more than bright enough for their intended use.  Worth the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  so i got this for my go bug out bag. this thing is light and has multiple things you can do.. now if only there was a way to know when the battery was full and the charging handle had a bigger handle to it, this would be perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great for when the electricity goes out. Love that you can listen to the radio and charge your phone.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is great. Power went out on my block during a storm and this came in handy. Multiple ways to charge and the flashlight is very bright. Its smaller than I thought but honestly perfect since carrying around something bulky would have been less than ideal.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought Incase we needed it for snow storms. Works perfectly and charges my phone. Light comes in handy.","positive":1},{"review":"  The day after I got it, we had  a power outage and my cell phone was running low. I used it to charge the phone and it worked well. Must have if you live anywhere weather or other natural disasters can cause an issue with power to your home.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product for your survival kit and emergency situations. The only thing I don't like is the crank is extremely difficult to use for someone like me that has a major problem using my fingers to do anything. However it can be charged just the same ways as your cellphone through your charger cord or your computer. Definitely worth the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  So cool. About 3\"x5\" with 1..\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 I seriously want to buy like 3-5 more of these.","positive":1},{"review":"  Seems to work as promised.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is a quality product and can help in an emergency.

It`s a little smaller than I expected, but the radio has a good sound, it does runoff batteries, Solar power, or the handcrank. It`s compact size makes it easy for travel also, and could be used as an emergency radio or to charge your cell phone when you`re in your car. Its also would be good to take for the beach, or camping.","positive":1},{"review":"  Gave a 4 for the battery life cause im not fully sure on it as i havent used it very much to know how well or how long itll work for. So far all works great. Sound and charging phones. Great price.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this just for emergency use, and it charged easily and worked just fine.  Whenever the hurricane warnings come, I make sure it is charged and ready.  Cannot comment on battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  Perfect product for any emergencies.  The solar power panel can sit in any window while traveling to juice it up.  Radio works well.  Great product for active people.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a very useful little radio. It takes regular batteries, has an internal battery you can charge or you can crank it. If you like to keep an emergency radio around in a power outage this lil guy will do the job.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE IT my small radio  is cute very loud, I have it on like 18 hours with gospel music at next day i touch if it was hot no in all.","positive":1},{"review":"  Some folks commented too small. My intent was for an emergency kit so I didn`t want something huge. The solar light is bright and so isxthe torch flashlight. I`ve tested everything off the LI-ION battery.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s very small. Like fit in your pocket small. I thought it was boom box sized. It does everything as the ad shows it sounds like an old radio because the speaker is tiny.","positive":1},{"review":"  I want a simple radio for emergencies. It's nice and small, picked up our local NOAA emergency broadcast station but it didn't match the station number on the radio dial, but that's not a problem. I like the flashlight and sos flash, and it has a pretty serious siren. It'll do the job.","positive":1},{"review":"  Best emergency radio I have tried. Amazing AM FM reception for its size, I can receive two of the NOAA weather frequencies. Very bright LED reading light and strong flashlight feature. Will definitely be purchasing several more as gifts.","positive":1},{"review":"  No trabaja la memoria.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good product but micro usb port came loose shortly after receiving it don't know whether it was defective or operator error.","positive":0},{"review":"  After one day of use my radio stop working it`s broke really disappointed .","positive":0},{"review":"  Smaller than I expected.","positive":0},{"review":"  Sound quality weak.","positive":0},{"review":"  The item was much much smaller than I anticipated. It was advertised looking much bigger.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like it, but the crank broke off after 1 week.","positive":0},{"review":"  Three months to the day this product broke the handle for the radio the crank broke right off and you cannot fix it anyway and of course the return time is already been closed so now my elderly father is stuck with something that is broke living in Florida.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just received it radio doesnt work but the flashlight and alarm work.","positive":0},{"review":"  The price is supposed to be $19.54 on the Lightening deal. There was 23 minutes left. Please adjust the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  If we have an emergency, it`s a great idea to put this in a emergency kit. Internet maybe down. Cover yr future, just in case.","positive":1},{"review":"  For a small radio this is excellent. The quality is exceptional the sound is warm and inviting very crisp and clear. It also has a solar panel to charge or a hand crank along with a USB port to charge your cell phone a flashlight the benefits are endless I love this thing.I believe this would be an excellent stocking stuffer as well after our Christmas is coming up.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great . Smaller than I thought but overall easy to use and charge, crank works . radio sound is good .","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed a radio for emergencies, one that could be powered manually in case of a long term power outage. I've used it for 3 hours with no problems, so far. Has some other neat features, too. Not bad for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little combo is amazing. I was shocked when I tuned the radio to the classical station on how crisp and clear the music was. Flashlight is very bright, size is easy to hold, and to pack.","positive":1},{"review":"  Radio, flashlight, cell phone charger all in one. It`s light and easy to carry and the sound quality is surprisingly good.  It`s all charged up but if the charge runs out I have batteries, solar charge and a crank. I feel confident that I`m covered in the event of an emergency.","positive":1},{"review":"  Happy with the product, for now. Bought it because we have a lot of power outages.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works good but needs a better entenna to be able to tune in the stations better.  Also a digital tunner would also work good.","positive":1},{"review":"  This will be a very vital piece if there ever would be a blackout. I use it at work on my desk for music radio...","positive":1},{"review":"  Finally got the item after a post office goof of weeks. It's a clever idea and one to be used in our regional hurricanes.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is junk from China save your time and money. It is cheaply made.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very cheaply made product. Much smaller than anticipated. Upon plugging in usb cord the piece fell into the unit. Won`t buy this again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Hand crank broke charging ports on aux did not work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was pleased  with the radio the first 2 days but  it blew through the  3 AAA batteries by the 3rd day of use.

Just what I wanted..  I`m happy so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works just from winding. Have not tested solar. Light works. Ready for an emergency.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this unit for home use as well as taking it with me in my travel trailer. The compact size is both durable and very good quality. No home should be without it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Was skeptical about this but was surprised how well it works. The solar panel does a great job,  picks up a charge in light clouds as well. Radio is great and will scare the crap out of you the first time it's turned on. Not many people ship to Alaska but happy these people do.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything works great. Will give me a nice peace of mind to have on hand during hurricane season. Radio comes in clear and everything is easy and simple to use. Glad I made this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product.  It was a little smaller than I expected, I'm sure I over looked the size, but it's nice that it doesn't take up much room in our hurricane supply box.","positive":1},{"review":"  I  did not  dislike  any thing. It was a great package. I would recommend it to anyone.

Bought it as supplement for PSPS in California. The radio worked great for any info regarding the Kincade fire and the 2 lights were plenty bright enough to light the hallway during the evening hours.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased to include in my hurricane preparedness kit.Lucky not to have needed to use as yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  We think it does a good job in all aspects: Radio, Charger, Flashlight.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is great product to have in an emergency.I encourage to buy this unit, very easy to use and maintain.","positive":1},{"review":"  Per se is not a power bank in case you`re looking for one, but still does a good work charging phones in emergencies. The Radio signal is good and the lamp is great.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is small, but for an emergency situation small can be good.

That`s a very long time to charge via the usb cable. Delivery was amazing, I received it exactly when they said I would.","positive":1},{"review":"  Brought for hurricane season.  Has been just to see how it works. Light is extremely bright radio picks up good stations.","positive":1},{"review":"  Only 4 stars because  haven't used cell charger yet, but solar  handcrank work as advertised or better. Use it at the pool and in the screen room and haven't switched to batteries yet.

Perfect solution to being without power or to take camping.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ordered this radio for my emergency Go Bag.

However right at the outset, the main keyboard was not functioning. I returned the product to the sender and I am awaiting for their reimbursement.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`ve owned or have auditioned more Chromebooks than I can actually remember (along with some high-end Ultrabooks). From the basic Samsung Series 3 to the high-end Pixel LS (my go-to machine).  This does speak to my wish that Google would include some basic user adjustable color saturation settings in Chrome OS.  As I stated earlier in my review, I am happy with the color quality and brightness level of R13 even if it isn`t the brightest or most colorful display available in a Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a certifiable Chrome device fan. My fascination with Chrome OS began with an all plastic, low-end Samsung Chromebook in 2012.112 (Official Build) (32-bit) and enabled Play Store access using the stable channel.

Each week brings another stack of exploits for Windows in a never ending floor, week after week.

I didn't have to do anything at all for the app to install .Not being paid for this review as sometimes others are .","positive":1},{"review":"  I am surprised by how much I love this machine. I wanted this screen size and the ability to run Android Apps, and I took a shot at this during a \"deal of the day. Love the touch screen in laptop mode more than I thought (I assumed I would only use that in tablet mode) and have actually really used tent mode when showing things to clients and I didn't think I would ever do that. Great battery life, great fast charge, nice keyboard - I'm really impressed.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my 4th Chromebook and it replaces the Acer Chromebook 14 which was very good also.  The Google Play store is working on the Dev Channel and this puts it over the top.  If you need a high octane score maybe a i5 or i7 will serve you better and with fast charging maybe 12 hour batteries aren't necessary.Chrome Remote Desktop works great, so combine a Chromebook with a Desktop PC and sky's the limit.","positive":1},{"review":"  I work as a system administrator and my computer is my life.  I need to have access to a charged laptop that is ready to use quickly.

First off very nice screen for HD 1080 P also very very bright which is great ...","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this to display sheet music which means using it in portrait mode.  The power switch is on one short side and the micro-SD on the opposite side.  I'll try that on an old SD card.I still give it 4 stars because it's a nice tablet and the full HD screen is nice and bright.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good for basic tasks, but the durability is suspect.

Called Acer Support.  They are sending me a shipping label to send the system in.","positive":0},{"review":"  We purchased this for my son in April 2018.  Worked fine at first, easy setup, no issues.  I figured by paying a little more for one, I would be getting a better product, apparently not. Just contacted the seller to see if the 1-year warranty will stand for this as I have proof of purchase through Amazon, but we'll see if they'll do anything for us.","positive":0},{"review":"  First thanks Amazon for lousy packing.. As noted, the unit would not recognize nor format this size of memory card.I will wait it out for another generation of products to hit the market before I replace my second Chromebook that is hanging in there.","positive":0},{"review":"  A few months after my wife had purchased an R 13 we were so happy with it that I purchased another for my own use. Approximately 18 months later my wife began noticing that he charging cable appeared loose in the port and she had to jiggle it to get it to connect well enough to charge the device. I would caution anyone to avoid purchasing this item without some kind of extended warranty. As it is a year of operation for a device like this is disappointing and Acer should be ashamed for not covering this defect.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm shocked at the software issues specific to this Acer R13. I've bought 4 Acer R11's in the last few years, and they were flawless. This didn't start happening until a couple of months ago, and now it happens almost everyday. Less often, maybe once per week lately, the top title bar does the same thing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had the Acer14 Chromebook which only lasted about a year and a half and now I am on track for the same longevity with this one. The hinges on the Acer 14 weakened to the point where the monitor would flop forwards and backwards constantly, and then essentially broke causing green and pink horizontal lines all over the screen. Do not recommend..","positive":0},{"review":"  I might have received a lemon. After a few minutes of it being powered on, the screen would respond to phantom touches: pinch to zoom. rando taps\u2026 no way to stop it besides closing it and reopening to reset the digitizer, but my unit would do it again and again. Completely unusable.","positive":0},{"review":"  On the surface this seems like a great device, but it`s not. I tried to give it a chance and assumed a lot of the frustration was due to learning a new system but no. After 2.5 hours of multiple deserts, hard power cycles, chats with IT and much frustration, I gave up trying to get the chrome book to recognize the card and opted to return the device.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a decent Chromebook, but for the price,I would expect more out of it. Start up is quick and seamless and the browser runs and loads at a very good speed. No point in getting a convertible chromebook if the tablet part can't function. Will be returning this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  Shockingly good. I was expecting poor performance but this thing hardly hiccups even when I have 20 tabs open. It stays in much better when I use my phone USB-C charging cable, though it's still not as tight as it is when I charge my phone. It was incredibly annoying at first, but the good battery life makes up for it since I just charge it an hour or two on a stable surface while I'm not using it and it goes for hours of video watching and document writing with no cord.","positive":1},{"review":"  Using it to write this review. Honestly, for the price I can't imagine a better deal. I have stopped using my 4 year old macbook pro in favor of this computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Before getting this, I had a Toshiba Windows 10 machine that was heavy, had a short battery life, was falling apart, and was becoming slower with each day--all of which made it hard to get stuff done. As a college student, I needed a quick, affordable solution for doing schoolwork on the go. Overall, this Chromebook meets my basic needs as a college student (portability, web browsing, typing papers, doing online homework), but will not replace the full functionality of a laptop. I use it as a compliment to (but not a replacement of) my laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to replace my ipad mini since it no longer received updates. I went with the convertible to use as a tablet but honestly i never used this as a tablet. Buffering full quality streams or video is a little choppy at first but overall great at bridging the gap between wanting a laptop or tablet. I wouldn't use this as my primary computer but great at being a mobile complement to my PC.","positive":1},{"review":"  One of the most noticeable features of the the Acer R13 is the build quality. It is a very nice looking piece of hardware.If you're looking for a mid-ranged price Chromebook, there are more than a few options. however, with all things being considered -price, build quality, features, and appearance- the Acer R13 just might offer the best deal for the dollar.","positive":1},{"review":"  i like it. it was between this and the asus c302. so the savings were significant, but like i said, the processor is worht the extra money. i will probably keep this chromebook until the next wave of chromebooks roll out in 2018 and then assess the situation to see if an upgrade is worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is so.idly built.I'm not a big fan of micro SD cards.  Too bad Acer didn't use full size SD reader (should be enough room.","positive":1},{"review":"  Best Prime Day Deal for 2017. It's nice when you find the chromebook you actually wanted $100 off. Also, though some reviews think the speakers are not very strong, I thought the speakers sound plenty loud, maybe a bit hollow but not uncommon for any laptop.Other Chromebooks are getting a lot of looks due the inclusion of a pen and 4:3 Display, the Acer R13 is a great deal at $300 (vs $400) for most users looking to have a Chromebook convertible.","positive":1},{"review":"  This chromebook is great.It is what i consider to be the perfect size to travel and for a student. or for the student in the family.  I would also recommend getting a square trade warranty with accidental damage to protect your investment.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a heavy user of resource hungry programs and my work laptop is fully loaded to get me through the day.  However when I get home my home laptop was also fully powered despite the fact that all I do is surf the web and watch Amazon Prime and Netflix.

The Acer R13 specs list it has a 12 hour battery and I routinely get between 11-12 hours between charges.","positive":1},{"review":"  Even though many have posted glowing reviews, this laptop is extremely slow due to poor optimization by google. Browsing HTML heavy websites bring this chromebook to its knees, and seemingly lightweight tasks are a struggle with its slow speed. Also, the touchscreen is faulty, with tons of phantom touches being registered at random, making the touchscreen completely useless. This is a hardware bug and since amazon support doesn't reach this far I am at a loss of what to do.","positive":0},{"review":"  Don't recommend this Chromebook, returned only 1.5 weeks after purchase. And to top it off, the track pad is crunchy (some kind of dual mode touch thing). Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money on the ASUS, or go big with the Pixelbook.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this hoping for the same great experience as my Acer R11. However there are at least two ways in which the hardware is lesser, making the machine extremely frustrating to use. Finally, and this might have been just an issue with my particular unit, Google Play Store crashed repeatedly, making it hard to install Android apps on the machine. I returned the R13, and will have to look elsewhere for a larger Chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved the Acer R 13 when I first got it, but it has developed problems with the space bar not working.  I have not spilled anything on the keyboard or damaged the laptop in any way. Whatever thecause, it isimpossibleto getany kind ofproductivity with this laptop because you have totype so slowly and go back to make corrections. Acer needs to fix this.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this Asus  Chromebook on August 25, 2019, because it was highly rated.  It was slow from the beginning. I will never buy another Asus computer. My experience with this one has convinced me that Asus does not make anything I would trust.","positive":0},{"review":"  I guess for the low price point it is probably actually ok. But, the laptop runs hot, like way hotter than I expected. The brightness, even on high, still feels dark, at least to me. I really wish this came with with a back lit keyboard, felt hard seeing the keys with the dull brightness on the screen.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was let down with this chromebook after enough use with it to really be able to give it an honest review. First issue is that it is slow, really slow...","positive":0},{"review":"  battery would not take a charge to last more than 15 minutes keyboard stuck different keys. returned and got different brand...","positive":0},{"review":"  Had this for a while and I won't be buying another one. From day one, the power cord did not fit in tight enough to the charging port causing it to fall out often. System chugs when watching 720 60 video on YouTube. Overall, it's serviceable but knowing what I know now, I would have not purchased a Chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this Jan'2018.  E-cycled it today (July'2019)...","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this laptop for about 4 months, and I've really enjoyed it so far. I decided to make the upgrade from an 11\" Acer Chromebook CB3-132 and am so glad I did. anything more RAM intensive or specific than internet browsing and I'd probably go for a beefier Windows or Mac. However, since Google's library of extensions and apps is only growing, it's going to remain a good computer for day to day use by the average person.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this product so that I could take it to class as my Mac is on its last legs and does not transport easily. Let it be known I did not buy this computer expecting it to last forever. If you plan on using the computer as mainly a laptop with the touchscreen as a convenient feature, then there should be no issue but if you plan to use it primarily as a tablet, you may find it uncomfortable and clunky. Overall, I find this to be a great piece of technology to have for surfing the Internet or taking notes.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer is great.. When it`s in the tent position it`s sounds fine. But over all of your looking for a great laptop I would recommend this one.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a fantastic device for home or light work needs. It feels durable, has most of the adequate port and technologies needed for daily use and connectivity. The only consideration to note is that this shouldn't be viewed as a replacement for a standard productivity device for work. It lacks the robust documentation presentation features and many of the apps aren't yet designed to run offline.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the most part, I really like this computer. It's a good price and the screen is just right for actually working with the computer on my lap, or at a desk table. The magnets keep it closed which is nice, but it definitely takes 2 hands to open it which is annoying. Other than that, it meets all my expectations.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very nice quality. Used for our son's school homework. We purchased a Wacom Bamboo stylus to use with the Chromebook.Recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  This replaced my I5 Dell laptop that crashed with W10 update.Definite learning curve to Android, nothing extreme but you have to learn to use it.Yes I recommend this unit at this time. As with any item long term use age may or may not keep the reviews positive.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very quick Chromebook, I love the all aluminum body, solid hinge not flimsy when you switch to a tablet. Screen is clear and bright. Would buy again..","positive":1},{"review":"  Great flexibility, and super fast.  This is my first tablet, and I am glad that I chose the convertible.but, it does everything that I want it to do.  I use my Samsung hotspot feature via Verizon and away I go for great streaming.","positive":1},{"review":"  Though ChromeOS can take some getting used to, this is an excellent purchase if you only use your laptop for easy things like online browsing, documents, etc. Chromebooks now have access to the Android app store, which makes the possibilities even more expansive. Too heavy to hold as a tablet, but I use the \"tent\" feature often when just watching videos. Though it's too heavy to use one-handed, this is a relatively light laptop that doesn't give me grief when I carry it in my backpack.","positive":1},{"review":"  I usually don't review items, but felt I should review this Chromebook since I can't contact Acer anymore without sending the item back. My wife has a Samsung Chromebook, it is awesome. Anyway, seems there are quite a few glitchy things that I have issues with that my wife doesn't on hers, can't think of any other reason than that this is an Acer. Spend the extra money on a Samsung.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for use mainly for work tasks when working from home.  It went great for a few months once I adjusted to the OS. Lights on, nothing showing.I'm done, I think.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was so over the moon with this product from the moment it arrived but then a week to the day after I received, the track pad stopped working and now, after much troubleshooting over the phone, I have to send it in for repair.This does NOT bode well for this product and is beyond disappointing for something brand new. Their customer service is lousy, ALL customer service is lousy these days to be honest-all hospitality and human contact has been lost.Total letdown.","positive":0},{"review":"  Battery drains about 10-15% a day while turned off and zero use. Not in sleep mode with the lid just closed, but powered off. I've powerwashed and uninstalled all third party apps and battery still drains. I realize now that chromebooks are trash.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love hate relationship actually. There is a ease in simplicity of using it but I am also frustrated as I can't locate certain keys like delete and at times a function occurs when I am simple moving my hand from one place to another.  Hopefully in time I can master that.  Otherwise it is fun.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've bought three of these now.  First one bounced along so after a year I bought two more for my other 2 kids entering HS.  2.5 years the max this puppy will work I guess.","positive":0},{"review":"  To start this, if you like androids, you`ll love this. But not being a android fan, I hated this.It`s more of a okay tablet with a keyboard then a actual two in one laptop. Needs more laptop features.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had it for about 3 minutes until I decided to return.  The trackpad left clicker barely worked and would get stuck in the down position only to randomly pop back up. In the hands if felt very cheap and can see why others are having durability issues.Went with another brand for about the same price and am more than excited about the new one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had a small issue connecting to WIFI and the idiot I spoke to had me delete everything on the computer. He didn't even tell me it was going to clear the computer. I was very upset and the moron hung up on me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I almost bought the Acer R 13 last December but I held off when I heard the Android operating system with play store will be available by year endThe fit and finish of the product is excellent the promise of having a tablet and a Chromebook in one device is very compellingI purchased the R-13 last week and received it on Saturday. I have spent over 10 hours trying to get the Android Play Store applications up and running only to find out that it doesn't workI called Acer technical support and they told me that I needed to contact Google technical support about the Android appsI called Google and they told me I needed to contact Acer. I suggest before you make any decision to purchase the Acer R-13 you see what the response is going to be to my question I posed to themUPDATE 12 15 17This product runs a beta version of Android and you need to switch between chrome os and android betaIMDB and Direct TV presently will not operate on this BETA version..","positive":0},{"review":"  According to my account I purchased this chromebook 2 years and 9 months ago. I have nothing but good things to say. I use it regularly as a computer and a tablet as well as sometimes as a makeshift tv for netflix when we are at hotels or when I visit my parents overnight. Seriously one of the best purchases I've ever made.","positive":1},{"review":"  My son's 5th grade class requires a chromebook or laptop, so we got him this. He's been using it daily for 5 months.if not, I'd buy this again. It's great for him.","positive":1},{"review":"  1 Nov. 2019  *The hinge (really the entire chromebook in general) feels less sturdy than the r11. My first impressions of the chromebook is good.I will update later on.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this. Great quality. People should only buy Macs if they need to use more intense programs or software. Chromebooks do everything the average computer user needs and I love Google Drive, Docs, everything.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a beautiful screen, and it has a very decent keyboard. It's thin and light. I currently own 3 chromebooks, and this Acer machine is slower than both of the other two, even though they're more than 2 years old.I use the device all the time, as it's great for browsing with a small number of tabs open or watching Amazon Prime or Netflix.","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely adore this machine. My desktop died and so I ran a second monitor off this guy and was able to install my coding software on the linux virtual box. Still waiting for everyone else to notice how amazing chromebooks are so that they get more native apps, but especially with the linux side you can run a lot of full desktop software on these.","positive":1},{"review":"  Based on my friend's review of the similar 11\" model, I looked into the Acer R13 Chromebook. I wanted something that I could unambiguously lock down tight during travel.I'm giving it a geek rating of 4 stars.  It would have been 5 if the power supply had not needed repairs right out of the box.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just arrived and I opened it up connected to power cord and it fired up instantly logged in with my Google credentials and very impressed at how quick it is how great the screen resolution is and how fast it started up any Microsoft Windows laptop takes forever and comes with all sorts of issues baked in I'm really thinking I'm going to like this experience..Can't believe I've tortured myself with bad Windows laptops for so long this thing for a fraction of the price as just as big as screen as many of my old laptops is a fraction of the weight and has incredible screen resolution it also has a very large keyboard with great spacing between the keys I'm 6-6 and easily Palm a basketball with big hands and the keyboard feels very comfortable..","positive":1},{"review":"  i`ve had this a few months now and it`s great. just because it`s a chromebook doesn`t mean it`s not a quality machine. looks very sleek and like a macbook honestly. i love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I did a lot of reasearch before chosing a Chromebook, and I am so happy with my decision.  I LOVE this Chromebook and would recommend it 100% without hesitation.  If you love Google, you will love this Chromebook.  Only improvement could be a backlit keyboard, other than that, FANTASTIC and worth every penny.","positive":1},{"review":"  Much slower than I expected. I use it for simple things such as email and typing up reports. It`s slow and after a few minutes the fan kicks in. I don`t know if it`s just mine but that fan is loud.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very rarely do I give less than 4-5 stars. When I first received this laptop I had high hopes. It is also a little heavier than I'd prefer, not really mobile being that it is a metal design. It is very nice looking though, and the screen quality is great.","positive":0},{"review":"  One day after the date I could return this Chromebook it started acting up. I did a Powerwash and went back to factory settings, didn't help. Did a full wipe and recovery and it still won't let us access the Google Play Store and without that you can't download apps. Very disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  This tablet keeps on crashing, one of the worst tablets I ever bought.. And I had it what 2 months maybe..","positive":0},{"review":"  Pretty upset about this product being 10 months old ( manufactured in Jan sold in Oct) by the time i received it and it didn't work properly out of the box.  It seems Chromebooks have many issues with WiFi, mine included.  Had to send it to Acer after 1 day to get wifi card repaired.  Be careful when ordering these.","positive":0},{"review":"  This provided all of the features you would expect from a cloud computer, but the hardware for me was questionable. Less than two years after purchase, the screen began to flicker and eventually just went black. This is not a high end chromebook, but I can't imagine anyone expecting to pay 3-400 dollars every two years for a cloud dummy terminal..","positive":0},{"review":"  I like everything about this chromebook, but less than a week into using it the battery died completely. I unplugged and replugged the battery, and ran a CROSH: battey_test, which said that there was no battery. If the battery had worked correctly, I would love this chromebook, but unfortunately I need to leave a poor rating for now.","positive":0},{"review":"  Current printer wouldnt work. Bought new Chromebook approved printer. Acer unit aOK. Avoid CHROMEBOOK.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great battery life and alternative laptop to other robust platforms. Unfortunately my screen has blanked at different times and I have had to power it off and back on. Still, the versatility to put it in beta mode and get apps off the Play Store is very nice.I think this is a great and tree Chromebook for anyone wanting to try it out.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great laptop although mine came with a difficult touchpad. The left button sometimes gotta press hard to click.Update: the power cord is already giving out. It flicking while charging laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  For anyone who likes Android, Chrome, and Linux, this is an outstanding laptop.The ChromeOS beta channel now supports Google Play store, so most Android apps run well.0 Type-A, and up to 64G of eMMC, storage isn't an issue.Add that it's fanless with great battery life of 8-12 hours and you just can't beat it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been using a Chromebook and a Windows notebook for several years. Over time I have found myself using the Windows notebook less and less and the Chromebook more and more. It is much heavier and larger than a tablet. When I need a tablet, I do not consider this a good option.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I have experienced the mouse jumping all over the place like others have described. It seems to have stopped for now. The quality of the case and the overall design, Plus it seems very fast and responsive. it this Jumping screen comes back I will lower it to 2 stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great screen, great battery, fast enough to do almost everything without lag. Struggles a little in some game apps. So after a few years of ownership, I've been very pleased with the price I paid. I was shopping for a new Chromebook the other day and can't say they make anything that can compete in this price range even today.","positive":1},{"review":"  I admit I'm a newbie to chromebooks but having said that, I'm totally impressed. My laptop died and I really didn't want to spend another $800 or more for a new one. It is in beta mode and all programs don't work perfectly, but it's definitely 100% worth doing with all you get from playstore.This is one of the best items I have bought for the money, the price has increased since I bought in October however.","positive":1},{"review":"  After two weeks, I love it. I used Crouton to side load Ubuntu and except for a problem with the switching back and forth not always working, it's been great having both variants of the operating system. With Google Play Store the value of the Chromebook has greatly increased. Except for Lightroom for photography, this Chromebook has taken the place of my $3,000 laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for my wife to replace an aging iPad.  She watches her favorite shows and works on documentation for work using Google's word processing and spreadsheet programs, which are generally compatible with MS Office.  This is one of the few acrobatic devices you can use in just about any position, with the keyboard or as a touchscreen.  I'd replace this in a heartbeat with the same thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was in a class when the instructor informed us that her 'only laptop' was accidentally dropped and she was scrambling around to get the information to us.  Yes, I was stressing - I have only a laptop that is a Dell (never again),  old and slow and now I can't turn it off because the button isn't functioning properly. I am so glad I purchased this and can take it with me- unlike my clunker that weighs a ton and a battery life of nothing.  Everything is backed up and a more reliable and FAST backup plan.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really love this chromebook but some things made it a step back.When I first got it, I plugged the charger in the chromebook and tried to turn it on. Battery life is questionable cause I checked the battery percentage and time and it tends to go up and down. I rarely used it at that time but after a while it seems to be stable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have not had luck with laptops, I have been in college for two years and this is my 4th laptop. I have had 2 HP laptops and they would not let me log in on my school account, the software was in protector mode or whatever and this was just a part of the windows operating system. But really that's not a huge deal. It is so easy to use and sleek, the design is elegant and the touchscreen is on point.","positive":1},{"review":"  We when reading reviews people said the hinge could be an issue well they are right 3 month of use and mine is seperating.  Kinda expensive for the low quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just a bit too slow for me. Even doing basic google doc editing the computer struggles to load pages and keep up with editing. The touch screen is great and the app support is nice, but it's just not up to 2017 standards imo.Might be a great device for someone understanding it's limitations, but not for my workflow.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this chromebook because I wanted something portable to edit and write on. It is very small. Wish I had returned it. Sits unused most of the time.","positive":0},{"review":"  Chromebook a were purchased for kids. The features were very nice.  We even purchased cases to help preserve - but didn`t even last a few weeks.  We have had previous chromebook a and all were tough and durable and stood up to every day as well as occasional unfortunate life happening and have never had one fall apart like this.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm going to save you a lot of tears, time, and heart ache. Do not purchase this Chromebook. I wish that I would have bought a regular laptop with more convenient capabilities. This is the most worthless piece of crap I have ever owned and if I could send it back, I would.","positive":0},{"review":"  The cursor seems to jump around to other parts of the page when typing.  The computer in my opinion operates a little \"quacky\".  Also, my HP wireless printer worked great with my old PC however I cannot get it to work with this machine.","positive":0},{"review":"  I hate this thing.  It is garbage.  That is too much money to drop on a piece of junk.  I would avoid this model at all cost.","positive":0},{"review":"  Wow Im really disappointed. Got the Chromebook September of last year. Thought it was the chord charger and bougjt a new one and it won't charge. Not sure what to do now.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this chromebook for my 14 year old son. After about 6 months of use, the hinges fell apart, which causes the screen to separate. I've seen this same issue on other recent reviews and would definitely stay away from this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing is a piece of crap. Can`t use google earth PRO a lot of apps are not compatible ...","positive":0},{"review":"  Great battery life, never seem to end. Nice display and quite fast. Hopefully will get fixed soon. Overall very happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Chromebook is exactly what I was looking for an more. Not only does it have an amazing picture, but the folding is much more sturdy than I thought it would be, and using it as a tablet is easy. There are several out there in the same price range, but this one had it all. I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  There's a lot to like about this Chromebook ..  Go for it ..","positive":1},{"review":"  Totally loving my new computer, it's very light and connects to our wifi's 5G unlike my previous computer, the battery also last very long and I love the brightness  volume bottoms, it makes it so easy to adjust.","positive":1},{"review":"  My order came sooner than expected, and I would like to say that so far I like my Acer Chromebook because of the fact that is has HD resolution, I do a lot of steaming so I want to get the beat quality that I can. I also decided to purchase this because now with the whole pandemic situation going on I have kids at home and I need note options to keep them entertained and so with this Chromebook I could search up coloring activities for them and print them out. I selected Google as my main search engine but for some reason when I do any search there is something that pops up and says that chrome cannot open that page. Also if used in tablet mode for long it locks up and you have to restart the Chromebook to get it to the way you want to use it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It hits all the right notes for me. Good battery life, durable, ergonomics, can run google apps and bounce easily between laptop and tablet mode. The display is crisp and bright, speakers are pretty decent. All in all, a great value for under 400.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great build quality, excellent screen and speakers, fantastic battery life. Only drawback is it only has one USB port - although it also has a USB-C port, keyboard is not backlit. Runs android apps very well and is fast and smooth. An excellent option for a low-cost chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  O give it a high five.. No issues with connectivity.No problems with external storage.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm really liking this Chromebook alot now that i've used for awhile. There is a learning curve coming from windows but its even better now that i've put the play store on it. Videos are great looking on it from Netflix and amazon.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this chromebook.I bought this because I was leaving my job and would be unable to use the laptop they gave me for work - HP Notebook which I LOOOOVED.but I knew exactly what I was buying, so that's my own deal. :)Other than those minor mentions above, if you need a laptop mainly for email, surfing, and you're familiar with Google Drive - this is awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  Not completely satisfied. Screen shake too much. Display is very reflective, like a mirror.","positive":0},{"review":"  Chrome book  is nice except the plug that came with it often comes out easily so it doesn`t get charged.","positive":0},{"review":"  weight was more than I expected.

What a waste...","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought a Acer Chromebook years ago when they first came out and since I never had an issue with that one, I bought the same brand when I was due for a new one. Graphics are great and it makes watching a movie or what ever a lot better. It's light and easy to carry. The boot up speed and browsing speed are of no issue but sure that will have something to do with your WiFi.","positive":1},{"review":"  This \"like new\" used model was so, but I think the camera was mechanically disabled, and have not been able to get it to work. So that is a big disappointment, and I am forced to use my old Lenovo for video meetings and get togethers. Of course, it does not have a backlit keyboard, which I subsequently have realized is a must have, however it converts to tablet and thus have a lit virtual keyboard that way.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you need a Chromebook for your Kids this is the one to get. I Loved how fast it got here. I am so Happy I chose this Chromebook. I would recommend this to any Parent looking.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very convenient to have for 90% of any browsing but the keyboard (specifically the spacebar) kills this for me. It is so inconsistent without me having to consciously hit the buttons very hard that anything with typing becomes a pain. Also, it occasionally struggles to seamlessly playback 1080p YouTube videos despite a healthy wireless connection and buffer space.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this chromebook. I do transcription work and needed something that I could quickly take out and use in between chasing after my 2 little girls. The one draw back that I`ve noticed is that it makes for a heavy tablet. All in all it`s exactly what I needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far my daughter loves this chrome book. Great price too. She`s 13 so we didn`t want to spend a ton of money on a computer but also didn`t want to get a Cheap one and have it not work like we`ve experienced in the past . Definitely recommend for anyone in the market for themselves or their ids for a New computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this for my kid to do distance learning during the pandemic. Worked great for that, and has been exceptional for personal use as well. I almost got a smaller non touch Chromebook but super happy I spent the extra $100 to get this one. I will say that Chromebooks have there issues, no Minecraft for instance, but it's no fault of this device or the seller.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great multi- use chromebook. The touch screen and keyboard combo works well. Not sure about ultimate fix yet. I would give it five, but the mic issue is real.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is really big for a tablet and medium for a laptop but I'm getting used to the size. The performance is good for its price range and the online forums for Chrome don't hate on it. It is a little thin and flimsy at times and they don't really make a good cover for it that works as a tablet but overall I would say it does not suck.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's amazing. I didn't even realize it was touch screen to be honest. I'm still figuring things out on it daily. But I love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  My kids have to reboot the thing every 15-20 minutes because it is frozen on a web page.  These are kid friendly web pages for school.","positive":0},{"review":"  4 month old acer R13 Chromebook that I really like developed what looks like a stress crack in the joint that connects the screen to the keyboard.

No redeeming qualities.","positive":0},{"review":"  It doesn't have words or note pad and I can't use with my printer.","positive":0},{"review":"  I doubted whether I wanted to buy a new tablet or a Chromebook. Glad I choose the Chromebook. Disadvantage is that you cannot use it with MS Office. But since my office documents at home aren't very complicated, Google's online office suffices for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am absolutely thrilled with this Chromebook.  I had two regular laptops with Windows. The set up was a breeze. Just a fun electronic, and I am very pleased.","positive":1},{"review":"  I transitioned from my 3-in-1 Lenovo laptop to this chromebook.

It works fine on the large screen.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this machine so far. I had an older chromebook that died. One was too small, one two large (+ no touch screen). And two malfunctioning HP.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this as a replacement to an older Asus 11.6 Chromebook. The fact that it is Android app compatible makes this a much more useable device in my opinion. I`d say it`s a good buy and have recommended it to some friends and coworkers already.","positive":1},{"review":"  t is a little different than what I am used to , but much faster in every thing you do .I am sure when I get it all figured out my rating will be a 5 star . The battery life is about 4 tjmes better than my dell laptop and charging time 3 times faster.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very nice laptop, probably the nicest chromebook I have used. Everything moves quickly even with several tabs open, I use it for online school. The only downsides are that the hinge seems a little flimsy and the keyboard is not backlit. Other than that it works very well and I have not had any issues.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this chromebook because I wanted a laptop that could easily display digital comics and .pdf rpgs full-size. Android apps on the r13 are smooth and responsive. I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and would recommend the r13 to anyone wanting a stylish, responsive 2-in-1 chromebook with a great screen and phenomenal battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a really great Chromebook. Only thing I wish it had was illuminated keys, but otherwise it's a boss. My wife and I each have a profile and I can easily run my Android apps right alongside having probably too many tabs open in the browser with little to no performance impact.","positive":1},{"review":"  Within a a few months of buying, touchscreen started sporadically reading contact that wasn`t there. It was a mild annoyance. Screen reads so many false points of contact that the screen is constantly moving and pages opening themselves, etc. It`s a shame because other than this, there are some nice features (size, battery life, screen resolution) but since I can`t use it most of the time it doesn`t even deserve one star.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broke after 4 months.","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved I until it wouldn't charge over 1 % Returned.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is our first Chromebook and at first I thought it would be easy to use but it's not that easy after all.","positive":0},{"review":"  This seems to be a high-quality product but the only (and big) thing that frustrates me is that it has very few language keyboards. If you're only intending to write in English, there is probably nothing you should worry about. Keyboard for my native language, which is everywhere on PC laptops, is not here, and that's been a HUGE disappointment for me because I never thought this problem existed until I bought this Chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  honestly, i got one and it wouldn`t turn on. i sent it back, got it repaired.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am having trouble returning this lab top the key board is not working right.","positive":0},{"review":"  The performance is fine, however the default language is French.  While you can change it to English, when you reset it, it goes back to French and you can change the language until after you log in and logging in can be a challenge as the keyboard layout is also French so the @ symbol for example, is not accessible using the 2 key as you might expect.  Another disadvantage is that the guest account is also in French and while you can change it, every time you log out of the guest account, the language is reset to French. I purchased this as a gift for someone who isn't particularly tech savvy so its far from ideal.","positive":0},{"review":"  Received this chromebook and I liked all the features and usability of the device. I had to return it though due to an issue with the chromebook not charging, the space bar isn't always correctly responsive, and after less than a week of use began crashing and losing all my tabs.who knows. I just know I wasn't gonna keep something that is more problematic than the chrome I was replacing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Out of the box wouldn't connect to wifi. Dialogue box would disappear when I entered the first digit for my password. Thanks Amazon..","positive":0},{"review":"  I work with chromebooks all day in a school district. This one is faster and has a better screen than most.I do not think you will be disappointed.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is such an awesome laptop. This is my first chromebook and I was a little hesitant on buying it but I'm very glad I did. I takes some time to get used to working only on the cloud but nothing that you can't do for the benefit of having a very affordable, great new computer.If you are willing to adapt and learn (it does take some getting used to a new system and software) this will give you by far the \"Best Bang for your buck\".","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my first Chromebook and first non-Apple product in 10 years. I love it. The touch screen really helps with that issue. I love it and would recommend to anybody looking for a Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  Feels like a very premium device.  My kids use it for online school and it works pretty good.  Wifi seems to be a little weaker than other devices in the same location.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall I love my new chromebook.  I would have rated it higher except for several small issues.  Sticking out some makes it easy to remove but since I view it as a permanent part of the book I never want to remove it.  Like I said small issues.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a Chromebook and it does what it should. Great screen and keyboard. I've had it for six months and the hinge-bits about which I was worried are holding up great.","positive":1},{"review":"  loved this Chromebook, good as I expected, use it every day, primarily basic use.","positive":1},{"review":"  Daughter is 9 was a gift and works perfect for her especially class work and they use chromebooks in school.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far so good, fit and is really good. Screen has nice resolution and the battery lasts soo long. The only thing I would take against it is that the track pad action when clicking is a little odd as the pad seems to hinge from the top instead of floating like most track pads.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sleek, modern and fast. This thing boots up almost instantly. Was a nice upgrade from his HP pentium 4 desktop. Very ergonomic and easy to hold in hands.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my elderly mother to replace her Apple iPad. I wanted her to have something with a keyboard, that she could do a little more on. The internet access seems slow and prone to ads--more so than the pad (I don't know why that would be). Overall it's a pretty clunky unit.","positive":0},{"review":"  Would not recommend getting this product at all. I have another chromebook at home and LOVE it. Then unplugged it an said I only had 15 Minute use time. Not buying Acer products again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought 1 for daughter for Christmas. Wrapped it and put under the tree. Will get a full refund shortly because Amazon has great customer service.I will try to purchase the item one more time if get another lemon I will be done with Acer Chromebook R 13.","positive":0},{"review":"  Malfunctioned after the first week.","positive":0},{"review":"  Based on the description, I expected to run Android apps and allow me to be as productive as I am on my laptop when working in Google Docs. It doesn't run Android apps. I am embedded with Google with mail and Drive and Docs. It seemed like I'd have everything I needed, tablet and laptop, in one, but what I got was a very heavy, slow, expensive web browser that I get to pay $20 to return.","positive":0},{"review":"  For me the floppy hinge totally ruins the device I had tried the R 11 before I got the R 13 and would easily pick the R 11 over the R 13 and you can actually use the R 11 like a tablet. If you use this with nothing behind the screen and then touch the screen it's like a diving board. I didn't have it long enough to review any of the other features like the supposedly bad mic issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worse laptop for a student. It cannot adapt to microsoft word and excel programs. Unable to cut and paste to clipboard. Its by far the worse student platform I ever experienced.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was fine with laptop for a couple weeks.. But what makes me furious is that they released better version of this a month later without saying anything. This is last time I'll buy anything from Acer.","positive":0},{"review":"  It came in a damaged box and wouldn't even turn on... very disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unfortunately I am not a huge fan of this. It`s easy for surfing the web, has great battery life but it doesn`t have the same functions of a traditional laptop. It wasn`t compatible with my printer so I had to buy a new one. Plus you can`t insert an SD card which is very inconvenient.","positive":0},{"review":"  I can have a frankly absurd amount of tabs running with no drop in performance. The keyboard feels nice, the interface is simple and the apps and such run wonderfully. Honestly I prefer it to my Toshiba laptop that was $1000 as it runs so much faster.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is still going and my daughter loves it. She has used it for college and continues to use it. That should tell you a lot..","positive":1},{"review":"  If you're like me, we both love nice things. Those nice things usually cost a pretty penny so I was a little skeptical about buying this because it's not super duper  pricy ...","positive":1},{"review":"  The chromebook is light and transports well.  I like the touch screen so that the keyboard can face down when needed.  The battery life lasts a long time so makes a great travel item.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent for someone who wants to surf web and use google docs to work on.  It has touch screen and long battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  Touchscreen is very efficient, no lag. Great HD quality. Battery life is GREAT.

Really long battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  Its so much easier and faster than a tablet.  I really like it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best laptop I have ever owned. I am just waiting for the Google Play to work on it and then it will be even better...","positive":1},{"review":"  For starters, i never post reviews. Obviously you never know the quality of the 'reviewer'. The touchscreen works surprisingly well and the quality is as good as anything. I understand this is ~100$ more then similar models but im happy i spent the money for better ram proccessor screen size 360 degree hinge touchscreen.","positive":1},{"review":"  Would be better with cd player and it easier to print from.","positive":0},{"review":"  Each Chromebook has a defined end of life date that is either based on the release date of the processor or the chromebook. In any event according to Google the end of life date is Sept 2021, which means the R13 won't receive security or feature updates after that date. Any way the current drop dead date for the R13 is now June 2024, an extension of almost 3 years. Still too soon in my opinion, but better.","positive":0},{"review":"  Won't accept \"Any size or make\" of Sds micro card. No need for slot or advertising expandable memory. I called Acer and got our \"friends\" in Pakistan. I could almost understand her .","positive":0},{"review":"  this laptops does not work properly cause is pretty more like a smartphone, the problems comes when you need to print, does not connect fast with printer, when you need to read cds, dvd's and the apps does not read the discs, you have to download an app for everything. I have a sonos system and the sonos apps for android (for this laptops) does not work properly and is frustrating. however the touchsreen works good, the keyboard and mouse pad feels good and comfy.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I first got this, it worked so well that I almost forgot that it's not a real computer. It's an internet appliance.  My memory isn't full - I assumed that'd be it but I have tons of space still left. It's a RAM and or processing speed combination issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I got the laptop, I was relatively satisfied, the performance is a bit limited, but for the price that's to be expectedHowever, after a few weeks I found a defect that caused the laptop to shut off while in tablet modeI contacted Acer to get it replaced, but all they could offer me was to send it to them to get repaired and get it back three weeks later.I'm pretty pissed about it, whats even the point of buying this laptop if you can't trust that you'll actually be able to use it when you need to.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am sorry to say that this is the 'glichiest', for lack of a better work, refurbished computer laptop I have owned. When I bought it through a Groupon deal, it came with a Acer Recertified 90 day warranty. )Avoid purchasing an Acer refurbished unit as the company cannot fix issues after purchase, even within the 90 day period. There should be a year's warranty on a refurbished unit as there are so many 'gliches'.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this product through Best Buy on a special they were running. A main use of this for me was to run a Bose bluetooth speaker playing Pandora or Google music throughout my workday. I regret buying it and I love pretty much everything from Google. Most everything else about this product is OK.","positive":0},{"review":"  I needed an upgrade from the $100 acer CB3-131-C3SZ I bought black friday 2015. I loved that chromebook even with the horrible screen because I simply could take it anywhere and not really care what happened to it. I think what makes me so frustrated is the price. Chromebook should be cheaper than windows, and this just isn't.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is my third Chromebook after my original Pixel and a different 15\" Acer Chromebook which my father has since claimed by eminent domain.  I have very simple requirements for my Chromebook: 1.Long story short, I can't recommend this computer because of what appears to be a ubiquitous problem with the touchscreen. Hopefully Acer makes it right for me so I can feel comfortable changing my review, but for now, I'm giving this computer 2 stars, as the touchscreen is imperative for one of my main uses of this computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really love my Asus Chromebook.  very impressed with its use and its pretty display, I'll never need another laptop.. from word processing to media.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent machine and as easy to use as my Android phone.

Make sure you understand how they work, it's not a regular PC type..The touch screen is an awesome feature, I would recommend this.","positive":1},{"review":"  The only complaint I have is that the touch screen can be very sensitive at times but overall I am very pleased with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it and that it converts so easily. I still can't download and play any google play apps like some other buyers stated they had. Other than that issue I love it. Awesome touch screen.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this chromebook. I use it everyday for school and it does everything that I need to get done.

Convertible feature was really appreciated for taking notes in her college classes.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wasn't sure of this purchase as this is my first chromebook i've got.

Not a powerhouse, but very nice upgrade for the price I got one for.  The only thing that really makes sense is planned obsolescence.  3-Star since charge port will last about 2 years even if very careful with it.","positive":0},{"review":"  A bit too slow, hard to have many tabs opened, but the device is decent.","positive":0},{"review":"  First in order to get Android apps you have to be in developers mode. When I changed this the TV that I had plugged in to use as a monitor no longer worked. There were a few other issues. Only 1- 3.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a great Chromebook and we have provisioned many of them to our staff. However, we recently learned about Google's Auto Update Expiration policy and this model will no longer receive automatic software updates after September 2021. Google has a support page that explains the Auto Update Expiration (AUE) Policy for each model and this one (CBT-312T) only has two years remaining. It seems like this information should be included in the product description since there are other Acer Chromebooks available that will not expire until 2024-2025.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just learning that Chromebooks are awful.  Let`s say you`re a student and all you want to do is use PowerPoint and Word like a normal person.  The WORST.

Still usable, but overall, not thoroughly pleased with the construction of this chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  This seems really good in all aspects other than the speakers. They are terrible, cant hear a damn thing, you'll need headphones to go with it.. find something else.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this chromebook from Costco and received it a little over a week ago.  It worked fine for several days and I was very happy with my purchase. date shown on the bottom of the chromebook was 11 30 2016,so maybe it is pre-programmed to start failing when the warranty is up.  I`m returning this lemon to the retailer and getting a refund.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had mine for about 1 week and the touchscreen has quit functioning twice.  I have found no other recourse than to do the Powerwash factory reset.5).  That would be perfect.","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros: This is a beautiful Chromebook.  It is well designed and built solidly.  I feel that performance within Chrome and with Chromecasts should be a non-negotiable.  It is possible that via updates, some resource management and re-prioritization could address this, but right now, as a fully updated device it is not a device I would recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  INCREDIBLE for the price. If you want a Chromebook then this is the one to get. I was about to drop over 500 on a laptop but then i saw this.","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter loves her Acer Chromebook. It light, good quality, ease of use. It's great for kids to learn computer basics and for school work.","positive":1},{"review":"  Some comments talk about the Chromebook being slow at times and I bought this expecting that.

I've been pleased with how it's handled those tasks in most situations.As a machine for single, simple tasks like web browsing, reading, and emailing, I see no downside to this computer. The same goes for multitaskers that stream media, so long as you have a solid WiFi signal wherever you plan on using the thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a solid Chromebook for staff use at our school. I have a couple of them in place and will purchase more as the need arises.The high resolution screen and larger size matters - and the durable hinges work well.","positive":1},{"review":"  Like the touch screen.  It's light weight , quite fast, and battery will go at least 8 hours of constant use.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very good laptop computer.

It's just the right size for her writing and school works. She's likes the programs that it comes with.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this Chromebook a while ago and it hasn't failed on me. One thing is that the bottom of the laptop, where the keyboard is, is actually plastic and I thought it was aluminum, but the lid is. Finally it seems very well put together and great for anything.

Especially for the price, this is a great little machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a very good and very powerfull computer, although it does have a few small technical issues. Firstly, this computer can get loud. Other good things about this laptop incldue the ridiculously fast boot up time, the room for more RAM and an extra SATA storage device, the anti dust fan system, the GPU and CPU chip being on opposite sides of the motherboard, and how light it is. Try not to spend more than $800-$900 on this.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought a decent MSI gaming laptop last year and it had glitches and crashes from the get go, things have smoothed out with it, but it's lost the original fps it used to operate at.

Never expected such a complete package of wonders from this laptop when all I was looking to upgrade in the first place was the fps I could play at, and maybe louder audio output, which it delivered on for sure.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just like expected in technical details and beautiful design. It comes with one only ram stick so, I suggest you to buy another one and upgrade asap to get better perfomance with the dual channel.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my son, He loves the 120 hertz display it comes with.

Should have 16gb minimum so you have to buy another 8gb stick for 40 bucks. Laptop works great, just noisier than it should be.

If it does get fixed, then I still have confidence that Asus is a good company to support.","positive":0},{"review":"  The computer came in fine and looked alright for its price, especially on Black Friday. However, I jumped the gun on the warranty and it came with it's own problem that isn't all that common. Bottom line, the PC would be great without the software issues and it looks like I'll need a clean installation of windows 10, instead of the system restore function. Be cautious when purchasing any product online, but especially this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  First of all I bought this laptop last black friday, overall the payment was succsesful and the item shipped quickly.The item box was perfect and the item itself doesn't seem to be damaged though the shipment. and league of legends was too.the 120hz is amazing and good it is the only thing i liked about this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  When the computer arrived, I noticed it was the wrong processor.

It is really fast and delivers aspects that would normally cost twice as much.

The Dell Latitude is much lighter, has a much improved keyboard and even with the Core i5 processor (on my model) it has all the processing speed that I need.

So, far the battery holds a charge for several hours, more than any other laptop I've owned.","positive":1},{"review":"  Obviously I can see scratches on the outer surface of this laptop.

This computer is useless and is going back.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't normally return items such as  electronics BUT I am not sure if I just got a bad Laptop or if the product itself isn't any good. I purchased the laptop brand new ( had it for 3 weeks) for school and after saving 4 homework assignments (small word docs) the laptop ran out of space.

The laptop is gor my daughter and she loves it. I was definitely concerned since it was refurbished but so far it has been great. I've only had it since December but it definitely has been worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  battery life is amazing. this thing can go on for 12 hours before it starts dying out. only reason i gave this 4 stars is for the amount of scratches the laptop has & how the battery is so beat up.","positive":1},{"review":"  The only complaint is that the battery plug area is very fickle and disconnects easily.

Versatile, lightweight, portable, clean and clear.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop itself is perfect for papers or internet. It's very well built and feels like a tank. The battery is great, I don't even bring the charger to school. Windows S is lame and I recommend installing Linux Manjaro or Lubuntu because they're lightweight and fast: you have to boot into bios with f2, then set bios password so you can disable secure boot.","positive":1},{"review":"  This review is solely based off of the assumption that someone would be using this as a secondary device, with a bigger laptop or PC at home.I was in the market for a 2-in-1 for school.TLDR- solid device well worth the shoestring asking price, especially if you're using it as a secondary device.  Definitely a great value.","positive":1},{"review":"  The first thing I noticed about this little laptop is that the case is made of metal, not plastic like most inexpensive laptops these days. It feels solid, like an expensive ultrabook. I've only tried the tablet mode once, and it seems to work fine from what I could tell. This laptop is meant to be used as a mobile device since the power cord is very short, but it works fine on just the battery and the the charge lasts a long time.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sleek, elegant, next level..","positive":1},{"review":"  This product does not have 8 cores as stated.

We wound up taking a newborn sleep class that recommended one and after learning that it`s easy to wean baby off the sound machine (I was nervous we`d create a fussy sleeper), we decided to give it a shot. New parents, treat yourself to this or register for it. Or if you have new parents in your life, this would make a great gift.","positive":1},{"review":"  Note: Although this says I purchased the Rohm, they accidentally sent the Hushh, and I didn't bother sending it back since I had a hard time deciding which one to get in the first place and thought they seemed pretty similar. So this review is for the Hushh, not the Rohm.Once, my husband said he could hear the strange music in the white noise that some people say they notice, but only once. I've never heard it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've only used it for two nights, but so far I like it a lot. It puts out a lot of sound. I'm going out of town next week and will definitely bring the Marpac with me. If I'd known you could get a good white noise machine this small, and for $35, I would have gotten one sooner.","positive":1},{"review":"  We have an original Marpac Dohm (mechanical fan) white noise sound machine, and 2 of the all-electronic Zohne units, which we love.  The white noise helps mask noise in our house while our 2 young children nap.I didn't knock a star off because of the lack of an adapter, since I knew ahead of time from the description it didn't come with one.  It gets a 5 star review though because the unit functions very well.","positive":1},{"review":"  So, I like this one because it has a good volume control and the noise it emits isn't in an obvious loop and there isn't anything jarring about it. I have several other white noise machines and I think they sound too loud or the loop is too short so it's very obvious. 1 sounds like maybe its rain, but it doesn't sound much different than the 3rd option which is just plain white noise.All in all, despite the cons, I still like it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Honest review after trying multiple things to help my son sleep.First of all the sound machine my son has now has a deep, almost inside of an air plane cabin noise that we use for him.  I wish I had found it before wasting money on other ones..","positive":1},{"review":"  Unfortunately this product was inoperable when it arrived. After a few days, I tried turning it on again and it worked, but only for about 3 days. I have had no issues with the Brand name product since purchase and will most likely re-purchase the portable version again through them in the future. I sincerely encourage Amazon to stop selling these counterfeit products as it discourages me from trusting that any of their products are legitimate.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really liked the idea of this sound machine. I use sound machines for sleeping and when I study so I purchased this one for travel. Once you hear it, you can't un-hear and it is very distracting. Sadly, this will be returned.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was great until the past two nights when it shut off at 3:45 AM and woke up us and our baby.  It had done that before when I had charged it and left it unplugged overnight.  Also, it is difficult to turn on and off, the button kind of sticks so you have to press it down hard for a long time.  As the product is less than 5 months old I would have expected it to last longer.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is nice if you need something loud. The volume does go plenty high. Like others have said, there is definitely some (with a lack of better way to explain it) background pattern that is rather annoying if you're sensitive to that. I can't sleep with it on and even my kids have complained about it.","positive":0},{"review":"  We bought it. We use it but it has all this weird sounds in the background. On the possitive side, it is very small and cute. Easy to take anywhere, but the weird noises makes me want to throw it out the window in the middle of the night.","positive":0},{"review":"  Biggest pile of over priced crap. I dont travel with this, I just have had this plugged in and use it at night and for naps for my infant. I have the regular marpac machines in my bedroom and my other child room so I know that this brand is usually a great and last forever,  it dont waste a dime on this item. It's really too bad.","positive":0},{"review":"  We bought this to use the ocean sound for our baby as we were sick of constantly buying batteries for our old machine.  I like that this is small and easy to use, but the ocean sound effect is a little bothersome for me.  Our old machine would keep a fairly consistent wave like sound that worked great for blocking out background noise.  This one has scared her a couple times, even with the volume down the random loud waves can be very startling.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this in October of 2018. I've had it for 18 months.I don't know if the one I got was a fluke, but reading other reviews it seems like it isn't. I really want to love Marpac products, but this Rhom machine makes it hard to trust how reliable and high quality their products are.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had never had any bad experiences with Amazon till this product. I bought this sound machine for my baby per the sleep training instructor's recommendation. Very disappointed and don't want Amazon's reputation to be damaged with bad products. Love Amazon, but this time is very hard for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very dissatisfied, based on reviews and descriptions of this product I was led to believe it would play all night long on a full charge.First night I used it and it died after only 6 hours. If for some reason mine is defective. Either way I would not recommend this product based on my experience.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've always slept with a fan, but when my perfect-sounding fan developed one of those annoying faint clicks, I wasn't able to find a new fan that was both loud enough and without some kind of slight clacking noise that I can't sleep with. I thought I'd try this, since it also looks perfect for travel. It's also super light, so would be great for travel, and recharges in about 10 minutes. It lasts at least 9 hours without recharging.","positive":1},{"review":"  March 2020: Juliann, in the yogasleep customer service department, reached out to us and wanted to make things right. She immediately sent three replacements to our home, which will ensure that we can use our dohm, rohm, and hush products again with our second baby in the coming months. The rohm also lost a lot of its power and sound over time and I feel like it already needs to be replaced, even though I purchased it 11 months ago. We are expecting our second baby and I was hoping to order more products, but I am worried about wasting more money on products that don't even last one year.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the second model I purchased from this company and both are excellent products.  I travel a lot for work and I always carry a white noise machine with me.  It would easily fit in a purse being not much bigger than a makeup compact.  I highly recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have the Marpac Dohm and use it every night. Lately I have been traveling a lot and was missing the white noise sound in my sleep but I couldn't take the Dohm because some countries I visited where 240V. Very small size, portable, and usb charging makes it great for travelling. Highly recommended for light sleepers like myself.","positive":1},{"review":"  Best machine we`ve used. Wish it was just a tad louder, sometimes when a noise is made while little man is napping, he is jarred by it on the video monitor. To have a baby sleep as well as he does blows my mind. Plus, since moving him into his own room I miss the noise.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for our toddler to sleep easier at night.  Works great, and has worked for several months now.  Placed this device towards the direction of the cows, turned up the volume to match the cows, and slept like a baby.  Woke up in the morning, turned off the white noise, and the cows were STILL moo-ing, we never noticed it thanks to this Rohm white noise device.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my wife who must have white noise. The good part is that the volume is loud enough, the controls are simple, and we didn't notice any obvious repeating sounds. Marpac says that it gets 10-22 hours depending on the volume level, which seems right. It's just a bummer to have to charge it EVERY DAY when I'm on a trip.","positive":1},{"review":"  There is nothing I don't like about this sound machine.  I purchased one for the first time two years ago when our first son was a month old.  They are small, rechargeable with USB charger (there's almost always one of those around no matter where you are), and hold their charge for hours (often used overnight).  I can't recommend them enough.","positive":1},{"review":"  We have the plug in version for our home.When we use this travel version, my child doesn`t like it..That being said, it`s incredibly convenient to travel with and lightweight, and I love you can hang from a door handle or lamp or drawer or whatever if you want too.","positive":1},{"review":"  Awesome product.  Was shocked to see a travel version was created by Marpac.Their customer service is top notch.  If you are having an issue with your Dohm, Rohm or other product from Marpac, send it to Marpac directly and they will make you happy like I am.","positive":1},{"review":"  The original Dohm Marpac sound machine is so incredible, this portable version doesn't provide the same high quality product. This sound machine is probably good for infants and that's about it.I use this machine for travel and it is better than nothing. But if I come across a better one I will replace this one and give to a friend with a baby.","positive":0},{"review":"  this Does not hold a charge for longer than four hours, and won`t turn on  make noise if it`s charging. So I can`t just keep it plugged in for longer use. The lack of consistency and poor charge makes this a no. But I`ve read they`re supposed to be made in the USA and mine says made in China, so maybe that`s why.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really wanted to love this. Unfortunately, my husband and I both really don`t like this sound machine at all because you have to hold down the power button for a solid 10 seconds before it turns on. We still use it since it`s small and nice for travel, but we DO NOT RECOMMEND it because of the cheap functioning buttons. There are plenty of other small sound machines- steer clear of this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this Rohm because I'd used my brother's Ohm and really liked it, but I travel a lot. The Rohm has higher-pitched sounds, more like static than the deeper fan sound of the Ohm. But I can't give the Rohm more than 3 stars. I did like the size and packability.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really wanted to love this. I liked the smaller size and the sound of the white noise. My family also brought it on many camping trips over the summer and the charge only lasted 3-4 hours again waking us all up when it would turn off.  After sleep being disrupted night after night due to this white noise machine, I have to choice but to stop using it and to throw it away.","positive":0},{"review":"  The first time I had ordered this product it Came to me broken. I was able to send back the broken product and get a replacement and it worked very well for a few months but yet again is now broken\u2026 I really love this for my son because we were able to keep it in his room and use it for travel but the fact that it keeps breaking out of nowhere is disappointing and it`s only six months old.. came to me broken.","positive":0},{"review":"  Update: this thing dies even while plugged in. Definitely don`t recommendThe sound on this little sound machine is excellent. I purchased the baby soundwave for my first baby two years ago and although it has to be plugged in it has worked reliably every single day night for the last 2+ years. What drew me to the rohm was that it was portable but it`s pointless if it`s dying all the time in the middle of the night.","positive":0},{"review":"  At first we really loved this little machine. It helped our baby fall and stay asleep...","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this based on the suggestion of Cara from Taking Cara Babies. The terrible thing is that I LOVED this sound machine. And when the machine shuts off the baby will wake up. So if you're planning on using this for your baby and don't plan on just having it plugged in, in the nursery, I'd find something else.","positive":0},{"review":"  Used 6 times and keeps shutting off in the middle of the night. Tried charging it and also keeping it plugged in. Had this thing about 6 weeks. Now it's a paperweight.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm an extremely light sleeper - I can't get through the night without a white noise machine to drown out the ambient noise. That said, I travel constantly, and found it really inconvenient to bring my regular one from home with me as I traverse the world: it's heavy and the TSA would frequently pull me aside to look it over and swab it for explosives. Fed up, I looked around and found this mighty mouse - it's small, lightweight, the cord is removable, and it's loud enough to be useful on the road. I recently used it in Mexico City where I stayed in one of the busiest parts of the city and it worked like a charm.","positive":1},{"review":"  This simple white noise unit has been perfect for travel. I`ve been traveling with this compact white noise machine for the last 6 weeks & its been perfect. It has a few sound options to choose from and I can adjust the volume, as needed. It doesn`t have super amazing, realistic, stereo sound but its great for what it is and its an especially nice size for travel.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little machine.  We have used a mechanical Rohm machine for many years, and have hauled it all over the world, even though it is very heavy.  We use it every night, here at home and all over the globe on our travels.  It is reliable and effective and a great value, in our opinion.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this little noise box a lot.  Got it to bring on trips for use with my son or daughter. Lasts about 2 full nights on a charge and it charges pretty slow maybe an hour before the light stopped blinking. Would definitely buy another depending on how long the batteries last.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this sound machine because it was portable hoping that it would be good for my new baby. It has been perfect, it can go in the car and around town with us, and it works so nicely to keep her peaceful and calm. The product is easy to use and straightforward. So far the battery life is also very good, it lasts all night and into the next afternoon with use during naps.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve had this for my 6 month old for a few months and it works very well. It`s very small and is very easy to travel with (I`ve stuck it in the car for on the go white noise. The battery life on this thing is awesome, and I`ve only had to charge it three times in a several weeks of use. My older son has also dropped this, and it is still in excellent condition.","positive":1},{"review":"  We alternated between the Soundbub and the Rohm for nighttime sleep daytime naps. After two months, we are stopping the Soundbub and have just bought a 2nd Rohm. I grew up with one of their larger Dohm sound machines and this little guy mimics the sound very well. Also no bright lights to disrupt your sleep, either (it does have a little orange light while charging).","positive":1},{"review":"  This would be a 5 star review if the battery lasted all night.  That said it usually poops out after 6-7 hours max on the loud setting.  The battery lasts better if the speaker is on lower volumes but we need it on loud at our house.  I just keep it plugged in, so problem solved.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this to deal with misophonia and tinnitus. I had the mechanical version (Dohm) previously but the motor failed eventually. I like the idea of having this with me while traveling, as it's higher quality than my smartphone speaker.Overall I don't like it quite as much as my old Dohm but it's a pretty decent second place.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this travel noise machine while staying with family in another state. Between tight quarters and a 2-hour timezone change, we needed a noise barrier between our kids and our hosts. We have occasionally had it shut off on its own even while plugged in, but it's a pretty rare occurrence. Overall we've been very happy with this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  It literally wouldn't shut off.  I would say I used the item maybe on 9 occasions in the last 4-5 weeks.  Unless you have some other place you wish to hang this item  (other than a doorknob) I don't recommend it.  Just get the type that sits on the floor.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have had the original Dohm sound machine for many years and love the simple white noise. I bought two of these travel versions for a trip we took over the summer (one for our room, one for our daughters' room). They should pull them off the market until they can fix these problems. Total waste of money :(  Until they fix them, you shouldn't waste yours.","positive":0},{"review":"  When it works well, this is fabulous. But about every other night there is an issue. but mine and my baby`s sleep are interrupted when it doesn`t. I`m past the return window, but am hoping the manufacturer will replace or refund because the flaws defeat the purpose of the product.","positive":0},{"review":"  NoOoOoO. This sound machine worked beautifully. But even more disappointed that I have a crying teething baby that wants the comfortable, familiar sound he`s grown used to to fall asleep and there`s no way for us to fix that right now. Probably a good idea to have a back up plan if you do purchase this.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this when my son was about a month old. He's five months old. I'm disappointed. I wanted to love this, but it's not worth the price for only 4 months of moderate use.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this portable sleep machine to take to my son's daycare.  However, when it arrived the buttons were already sticking.  The \"S\" button frequently gets stuck down and then makes it impossible to turn off.  I need to wait until the battery dies for it to stop and then charge it again which is a pain and makes it impossible to continually use.","positive":0},{"review":"  I feel terrible giving a 3 star review because i actually do LOVE this product. The sound & volume are great, and i can't detect any loop like you do with some other noise machines. Unfortunately, i have gone through three of them as they just seem to poop out after a while. The plug also doesn't stay in the hole very securely if you keep it plugged in to use all night long like i do.","positive":0},{"review":"  I originally purchased the sound machine November 30 and after less than 1 week the machine stopped working. Even after a full charge the sound machine wouldn't turn on. Save your money and find a different sound machine. I did love the compact size and the variety of sounds it made but its not worth the headache.","positive":0},{"review":"  We really liked this at first, my son has used it since he was only a few weeks old. He`s 8 months now and the sound quality and greatly deteriorated, it`s about half the volume it was when we first got it. We compared it to a friend`s machine they just got, and theirs is so much louder. Maybe we have a defective one.","positive":0},{"review":"  Super disappointed.. We can`t even use it anymore because it won`t hold a charge with or without it being plugged in. I keep reading reviews about the poor quality and now I understand why.","positive":0},{"review":"  We got this for international travel and it was one of the most important things we brought, used it for every nap time and every night. Easy to charge, easily lasts all night plus nap time (12+ hours without failing), and the quality of noise was nice for everyone as we slept in the same room - I only use the deeper white noise. It's compact, light but solid construction so it doesn't feel cheap, and the rope makes it easy to hang on anything within reach. It's one of our favorite things to take with us when we're going to be away from his Dohm sound machine at home (same company).","positive":1},{"review":"  Was a little concerned about the quality and volume of the noise.  We have the full sized Rohms in our home and quite frankly can`t sleep without them anymore.EDIT:  Have taken a couple of trips with this and it is hands down better than traveling with the full sized Rohm.  In fact we are going to purchase a second unit in case we are traveling at the same time to different destinations.","positive":1},{"review":"  Whenever I forget a noise machine I end up using my phone, and then I have to 1) be without my phone while baby sleeps, and 2) make sure they phone isn't going to make any other noise during sleep time.This works great and makes pleasant white noise, for babies or adults. I feel like I've had it run out of battery over night, so I try to keep it plugged in if I plan on using it for a longer stretch of time. If you keep it plugged in, it there are no issues.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this. Ordered it for my 4th baby, prior to that, I`d been using a white noise app on my phone but hated not having my phone handy if I needed it. And it still works even when plugged in.It keeps baby asleep even when his 3 older siblings are going crazy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I do not typically write reviews but I had to for this one. My little girl (3mths) loves this. I wish it had an easier attachment method.This was definitely easy to overlook when I realized how much my little loved it.","positive":1},{"review":"  bought this for an italian vacation and it was worth every penny.. the volume was adjustable and loud enough for what we were drowning out. i cant wait to use this camping instead of a fan app.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this little thing every single day. I used to wake up every night. When i bought this machine it took a little getting used to but now i can sleep through the night. Some nights when i forget to charge it and it runs out of battery i wake up at night.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best portable sound machine EVER. I have the hatch baby sound machine in the nursery and was tired of packing it up and traveling with it every time we went somewhere. This little machine gets LOUD too. Overall great purchase, I highly highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little noise maker is perfect for use at home or to travel. It`s compact, but it can put out plenty of volume if you`re trying to cancel out noises with some white noise for sleeping. I usually just leave ours plugged in at home, but when traveling and on the road without a way to recharge it during the day, we found that it held its charge for at least 2-3 nights. I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was the perfect product to bring along on our trip to France. I always sleep with a fan on and couldn`t expect there to be one in our hotels.. and outside noise.","positive":1},{"review":"  So disappointed. I don't have all the money in the world to spend on a noise machine, but this was recommeneded via Taking Cara Babies. $31 may be a little to some people but it is a decent chunk of money to me for a sound machine. At this point it is just a hassle to deal with, but doesn't even matter anymore because it stopped working.","positive":0},{"review":"  Wish I could return or request a replacement.Bought this for our child's room. Our original one does not have this same issue.  Sadly disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  I did not use it often.  But I stopped being able to switch between the different sounds.I like one of the sounds that it makes (the deep white noise).  I dislike the bright white noise, and the changing volume of the  surf sound makes it hard for me to tune out.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this sound machine a few months ago in preparation for the arrival of our baby and I just got around to try charging it and getting it ready. Unfortunately it never turns on. The light slowly blinks like its charging and turns off but then whenever I hold the on off button for 3 seconds it never plays any sound. I'm really upset because this had such good reviews and its past the amazon return date now.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was my first time buying a white-noise device, and I looked around at a lot of options. I saw some negative reviews about malfunctioning products, but figured that it was probably just people who didn't know how to use it right, and the price, size and style were appealing enough that I figured it was worth the risk. Bought this only to have it critically malfunction right out of the box.Save yourself the money and buy something else.","positive":0},{"review":"  Despite reading several recent negative reviews, I took a chance on this. It worked great for 3 weeks, and then suddenly the buttons stopped working & it was stuck in the \"on\" position. We bought this for travel, expecting the same quality. Not so.","positive":0},{"review":"  We recently purchased the Rohm after owning and using the Hushh for years and it stopped working. I purchased the Rohm just a few months ago and it would never turn on while it was plugged in, so I would have to unplug it, turn it on, then plug it in again. My return window closed 20 days ago now I am stuck with a sound machine that won't turn off. Please help and replace.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is so nice and small and easy to carry in a suitcase.  I have had it for a couple of years now.  I am looking for something non-looping.  I don't need a bunch of different sounds, just the quality white noise I have come to expect from many years of using a \"Sleep-Mate\" from Marpac.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased one of these for in my baby's nursery and absolutely love it and it does a wonderful job. I liked it so much I purchased 2 more for our second little ones nursery and our own bedroom. I'm very disappointed that they are nothing like the original I received and now have to spend extra money to purchase something that will meet our needs. I gave it 2 stars because I do love the original one so much.","positive":0},{"review":"  Do not buy the battery operated models.  I bought one as a package deal with the standard plug-in model (Which we love).  The new one lasted longer.  Probably between 10 and 20 uses uses before it did the exact same thing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have been using this day and night for the past 2 years. It's amazing.we were at a wedding in some cabins, power went out at night, the other families with kids were up in the night because their regular sound machine turned off, we slept and didn't realize power was out. I just absolutely love this thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you`re debating sound machines, this is the one. We bought this one for outings, but have ended up using it for the nursery for the last year. Cannot be powered on off while plugged in. Again, just something you get used to.","positive":1},{"review":"  **UPDATED**Since my original review I`ve been in contact with Marpac customer support directly. They are incredible. This is disappointing. I like the machine, but with the button being stuck it's impractical to travel with as it turns on randomly and causes the battery to drain.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for our 8 week old baby. We had the Hatch Baby Rest sound machine which we thought worked well, until we bought this and heard how much louder and deeper this noise was. Also helps me sleep because I don't hear every little peep he makes while sleeping. :) We got this version because it was $10 cheaper than the baby specific version and works just as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have seen all of the mixed reviews of this product and was a tad nervous to get this, but I love it. Not only does it help my baby sleep and block out a lot of extra noise, I can`t sleep without it. Most days I leave it on all day long and so far it`s still in great condition.10 10 recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  i brought this sound machine to the beach to help drown out some noise for my son while he was napping and OH MY GOSH. Best sound machine ever.it is even better than the sound machine i have in his room.i would buy this for every new parent.","positive":1},{"review":"  Wow. Just wow. But I am honestly not too bothered by it. I would just recommend packing it with clothes or other similarly soft things to avoid that.","positive":1},{"review":"  We bought this portable noise machine when we had a baby about three months ago. This was the second noise machine we purchased for the house, and we decided that purchasing a portable machine would be wise. This noise provides a sense of calm and security, and we use it at home and while traveling.I am very happy with this machine, and would recommend to anyone who is interested in better sleep quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  We have used the Marpac $70 sound machine for over 15 years - have bought a replacement cord once or twice. We wanted another travel machine and read the reviews on this smaller Marpac model.. I used it at a work conference and it completely helped with the hotel sound and snoring roommate.","positive":1},{"review":"  I suffer from sever insomnia and this has been an amazing investment. I've tried others and didn't like them at all...","positive":1},{"review":"  Hi, this is the 3rd unit that I buy of the same. I first bought a unit in July 2019 to go on a cruise for November. Very disappointed. I am asking for a refund for this last one at least.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is a complete godsend. In fact we bought two to have a backup. And thank god we did, because the only reason I am giving it 1 star is because one of our two noise machines just up and stopped playing after less than 2 months of having it. At least we have the backup one but still.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is the second time I purchased this portable sound machine from Amazon because people seem to love it.  It worked fine originally.I had purchased this same product previously and encountered the EXACT same issue - so clearly it's a universal manufacturing flaw.  I would strongly advise looking into a different brand.","positive":0},{"review":"  We so wanted to love this. We bought the full size Marpac machine and, in spite of never having been \"white noise\" people, got completely hooked in just a couple of days (we live in the middle of the city). We can't wait to find a travel white noise machine that dependably works. This isn't the one.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very disappointed that this product will not work within 6 months of purchase.  We tried everything to troubleshoot. I will contact Amazon and the company for followup.  Instead of paying for a separate device such as this, save your money and  download a sleeping app on your phone.","positive":0},{"review":"  My wife and I love the full size version of this sound machine, so we thought we'd try the portable version. Started out working great, but on the 3rd trip the volume control began to malfunction and it automatically went to the loudest setting. As a travel aid, we just didn't have many chances to use it in that first 30-day period. I do NOT recommend this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Shuts off by itself when fully charged even when plugged in. Has woken up my baby twice because of this reason. Very upset and frustrated.","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved this little machine for about the first 5 weeks of use. Then it got really wacky.It drives me crazy and I tried to deal with it but it`s jjst getting worse. It seemed out of the blue since it wasn`t dropped or mishandled.","positive":0},{"review":"  This review would have been 5 stars if the machine hadn't broken within 2 weeks of use. It works great, it gets loud enough to drown out EVERYTHING else, and the portability is a huge plus.. The issue is with the machine itself, and honestly, the customer service representatives gave me zero response when I posted in Amazon's forum asking for advice warranty information.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like everything about this sound machine except for the fact that it does not last through the night without being plugged in. I specifically purchased this for traveling with my baby, who sometimes sleeps in a pac'n'play that is not close to an outlet. After using this for the first time on a trip and having interrupted sleep due to this machine abruptly cutting off in the middle of the night I'm disappointed that the length of the battery life was not shared. I fully charged it before each night and it lasted less than 8 hours.","positive":0},{"review":"  We take this everywhere we go. My baby sleeps so good in the car seat without his brother waking him up. Charges quickly and last a really long time. I would highly recommend to all moms as it was recommended to me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this white noise maker.  My daughter has slept in longer than she usually does. So she would be up at 6 or 7 in the morning on the weekends, but when I put this on she has been waking up at 9 in the morning. So I get to sleep in.","positive":1},{"review":"  Originally heard about this product off of an Instagram blogger so decided to give it a try to transition my son into his crib. Although I still have struggled with putting him in the crib this sound machine is awesome for relaxing him.  I like that there`s not too many buttons and is very upfront on what to push. It`s also plus that it is rechargeable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm buying my second one of these things.  I just bought one last month that we used when our family traveled to Germany.  We could hear it in all the rooms plus the main living area, and it really helped our sleeping.  I'm always going to travel with these things.","positive":1},{"review":"  Our 3 month old loves the bathroom fan in our apartment. It`s what calms him down and pretty much puts him to sleep. For naps it puts him to sleep in 10-5 min and keeps him asleep.Would definitely recommend if your baby love`s white noise.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm off and on with using this product. It definitely does what it's supposed to do. It helps my little one sleep sometime but im honestly not as consistent as I should be. Do I recommend you purchase this product yes because I feel it helps especially if you're consistently using it during nap and sleep time.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little machine really delivers.. Marpec makes amazing products. I also love that they are endorsed by the national sleep association.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a must have for new babies you are trying to get on a good sleep pattern. I first learned of this white noise machine from Taking Cara Babies and decided to give it a shot. We have gone through a few of these machines since they stop working after awhile, but when they are running for 12-14 hours a day that can be expected.The battery life is good - but in order to make it through a full 12 hour night, we keep it plugged into the wall.","positive":1},{"review":"  I absolutely love this item. Best investment. I put it on top of her stroller, and covered the stroller and she took 2 hour naps. The best.","positive":1},{"review":"  I own the bigger Marpac Dohm for use at home (love it).  That one is too big to travel with so I bought this small Rohm.  The volume can be adjusted \u2013 this can be very loud.I have no problems with it lasting the whole night on a charge.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought one for our son 2 years ago and it is great. Bought another one for our second child and it was a cheap knock off. Tried ordering another in hopes it was a fluke and received another cheap knock off. This is a great sound machine but id suggest ordering directly from marpacs site.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you`d asked me last week, I would have said I loved this tiny machine. The noise level was nice and loud, good white noise.We`ve already purchased the hush version of this product and if that goes out on us, too, in a year I`ll come back at possibly drop this another star. It`s very unfortunate.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this sound machine and hadn`t had a chance to use it until this week when we took our 8 month old on vacation for the first time. I like how compact this unit is and the noise volume is perfect but we used it the first night and it quit in the middle of the night and it will not turn back on. I made sure it was charged and even left it in the outlet the next day but still nothing. I`m sending it back and getting a replacement in hopes it was just a fluke.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this product twice now.  They work for a few months but then they have a disturbing crackle squelch sounding interference.  Sounds great for now.  Let's see what the future brings.","positive":0},{"review":"  We purchased this sound machine to use in our baby`s room. After having it for less than two months, it sometimes will not turn on, other times it just turns off after 10 seconds or sometimes an hour later. the real Rohm from Marpac will say made in the USA. The window has closed to return but this is such a huge disappointment and waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  The first time I used this machine it worked great. However the second time I used it, it seemed defective. I have owned this product less than a week. For $20 it`s not even worth the hassle to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  We wanted to love this. But it's on a digital loop, and you can hear very annoying high pitched noises when it's running. I unplugged it and returned it. Go with the traditional Marpac sound machines instead.","positive":0},{"review":"  We use this in our baby`s room. I wish it would go louder, but it`s adequate if you can put it nearby. You must keep it plugged in if you intend for it to last 10-12 hours. I haven`t tested exactly how long it lasts on a full charge, but I have forgotten to plug it in a few times and go in early in the morning to find it has shut off.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the sound this produces. It's loud enough. I will spend about 5 minutes trying to get it to turn on if it is plugged in, where as if it isn't plugged in it turns right on. Not sure if I got a faulty one, but its become quite an annoyance for us which is disappointing because several people recommended this to us.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to use while traveling with my baby. It worked great for the first few days, but after using it for a week a number of problems emerged:-the button on the side to turn it on seems to have some problems. We repeat this over and over until I give up. The machine is plugged in, so it's not running out of batteries - it's just crappy quality that doesn't consistently work and after using it for a week I need to replace it.","positive":0},{"review":"  A necessity for traveling. We have the standard marpac sound machine and our friends suggested we also invest in the travel version.  Surprisingly it has the ability to be really loud. This is a must have for all new parents.","positive":1},{"review":"  it makes a good deep sound just like the ones that are plugged into the wall. However the battery does run down in just a short period Of time. I already have my sound machine, so I bought this for my dog. She has excellent hearing and tends to notice little noises iand bark in the night.","positive":1},{"review":"  Life saver. Especially for traveling. So if you`re trying to keep a dark environment that light can be annoying. Other than that, you need this for your baby or self.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a life saver when traveling. We use sound machines at home but sometimes it's a lot to pack 3 sounds machines. Only wish it came with an outlet plug so I didn't have to search for one every time we use it. Other than that great buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve tried 4 other sound machines all purchased on amazon, this is by far the best sound quality.  It only has a couple sound choices but I only use one sound on them anyway. This is the travel one but it can get super loud so no need to get the bigger one.  Plus then it`s perfect for travel.","positive":1},{"review":"  We use this for our 5 month old in her nursery. We have a toddler as well, so we like to block out his noise. Plus this one is way more portable than the first machine we bought. Definitely worth the sale price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This noise machine has great reviews for a reason. It's an excellent and well thought out design. A more soothing ocean sound should be very slow waves, which is more relaxing and can calm you down. If you're looking for a compact machine for both home and travel, this is the one to get.","positive":1},{"review":"  I originally bought two of these for my toddler who is a very light sleeper (when he sleeps at all), one for home and one for Grandma's house. Not only did Grandma end up keeping and using hers, but an adult friend who was over one evening loved it so much, I bought her one as a gift.  We take it on every vacation and overnight adventure. And recommend it to everyone who needs to block out all the noises that are keeping their little (and big) ones awake.","positive":1},{"review":"  New time mom here & this is hands down my favorite registry item. Brought it day one when baby was born, using it in the hospital, place it in her carseat and use it anytime she sleeps (any place anywhere)...","positive":1},{"review":"  I really love this little machine, especially the volume button feature on the side. We had the Marpac Dohm machine that we got as a gift that worked fine for us until our 11 month old dropped it on ground. Seaside to white noise, our little man sleeps undisturbed. Don`t pay $50 for the Dohm.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have two of these, this white one and the grey version. Which I recently learned is a slightly different model. The battery can`t last for more than one nap and the noise will randomly fade out to nothing.Really a bummer because the grey one works great.","positive":0},{"review":"  My baby sleeps much better when the sound machine is on, however it is hard to turn on. For this sound machine, you're supposed to use the top button to turn it on, but sometimes it doesn't work at all. It seems that some days, pressing and holding works, meanwhile other days you just press it many times and wait till you hear the sound start.Although I like this device, it is very frustrating that turning it on is unpredictable at best.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'd give it 0 starts if I could. It's used for my baby's sleeping at all times. There are a million white noise machines on the market. Do not buy this one if you want your baby to sleep.","positive":0},{"review":"  We previously had a Marpac Hushh that worked famously until it just stopped working.  I bought the Marpac Rohm thinking that it was the same. It never turns on immediately. I just purchased the Marpac Hushh as a replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wish I could love this. I was so pumped on the design and I already use the plug in version, but there is an obvious electronic beep on loop that will drive you MAD, I had to turn it off and return. FIX THIS issue and im sure a lot of people wont return it, the sound is great minus this beep on loop.","positive":0},{"review":"  The sound is amazing and powerful. I`m just so disappointed that this is the second one I`m having to replace within a few months. It needs to stay in one location always. Too risky for on the go.","positive":0},{"review":"  Does not last through the night, which is what I was looking for. I like the blue color and it`s lightweight design but unless you want to have it plugged in, it does not last 10 hours at about 80% volume. I have been using it for a month but now I wish I could return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love the noise, the weight, volume levels, just wish it worked. When I first got it I had a hard time getting it to turn on and would have to push power several times. Then it worked fine. Now it works fine if just sitting on table but if I move it or pack it to go on, it constantly turns on without me pushing a button and once without me knowing which wore out the battery.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this for naps at grandma's house for my 4 month old. It just doesn't get loud enough to block any sound from the rest of the house even though my baby has a dedicated room there. but it's not what I originally wanted it for. I would recommend getting a Lectrofan or the Hatch.","positive":0},{"review":"  Apparently when this is fully charged it flashes an annoying light. I thought I was doing something wrong. Baby. A device meant to aid in sleep should not have a repetitive flashing light to let you know it`s charged.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was looking for a small, portable sound machine for travel. This is small and simple, not a lot of buttons, and certainly loud enough to get the job done. I charge for an hour or two before bed and then I'm good for the 8 hours of sleep I get. Works exactly as I need it to.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very convenient. I have a larger one for home.If I used it for naps I needed to charge it for night as it only keeps a charge so long.  Wish it came with a carrying case for it and it`s cord.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great idea - small, easy to travel, rechargable battery. It fits in the palm of your hand, easy to hang. I like the size, buttons, simplicity, ability to hang.I like this product, although I am disappointed that it can't be used as I'd hoped - using it on battery power all night.","positive":1},{"review":"  BUY THIS NOW IF YOU HAVE A BABY. I wish I could give it another bonus star. (Doesn`t sound recorded - sounds like the same physical motor on the Dohm even though it`s not.) We use this daily and I`m looking forward to taking it traveling with us instead of lugging our bigger units or using crappy backup sound machines.","positive":1},{"review":"  I own the tabletop version of this machine and wanted a smaller, portable version for traveling. This item was perfect. In my experience, the fully charged battery lasts almost 2 nights (on the second morning I will wake up to it turned off) so I have to remember to bring the charging cable with the unit. I hope this lasts me a long time so I can enjoy it on all my travels.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good battery life and great volume for the size of the device. Different white noise than the floor models, but being that it`s a speaker and not a fan it has multiple sound options. Overall it`s been really helpful for travel, be it in the car seat, on the plane, or overnight in strange places.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can`t sleep in silence so I purchased this for vacation in disney. We took a cheap room near busses, the beeping never woke me up at all. I slept through the power outage until the rest of the family decided to wake me bc they no longer had noise sleep machine running. It allowed us all to fall back asleep when everyone climbed in bed w my husband & I.","positive":1},{"review":"  There are three settings: a higher pitch \"white noise\", a nice medium, and then waves. The volume control is helpful and also the fact that I can keep it plugged in or use it w o a cord.I dug it out of my travel bag and was a Very happy woman. Enjoy.","positive":1},{"review":"  We`ve used this since our son was one week old and is now 2 years. Use for every nap and bedtime. We cannot live without it due to him being a light sleeper. Ordered a second one even.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this for almost 2 years now and just getting around to writing a review. I love it. It`s easy to take with if I travel and helps block out ambient noise in hotels, etc. it`s powerful for how strong it is.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was the 2nd time I purchased this item, and as other reviews before me wrote, the quality has greatly deteriorated.  I spend up to a minute playing around with the power button to get the thing to turn on.  Very disappointing I missed the window for returning.  I do not recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  As others have mentioned, this thing has a mind of its own. It turns on and off when it pleases. Their customer service is MIA. 1 star do not buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this white noise hoping it would help with my baby sleep and specially because the portability, after two months of use it changed the sound out of the blue during nap time but I didn`t think much of it, now it changes the sound every time, and it just disturbs my baby sleep. It goes around to every sound so fast.Of course I can`t return it anymore.Save your money and buy another product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Like the headline states, I had ordered the device to be used for travel, So I didn't test it immediately after purchasing the device. About a month or two after buying it, I opened it up only to find that it didn't seem to charge and would not work at all. Couldn't file for an RMA at that point via Amazon and didn't feel like pursuing it any further.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this item twice now and it stopped working both times.  The first time it lasted 6 months and I loved it so I thought hey, 6 months for $29.  I honestly love how loud it gets and how its so portable but this is getting ridiculous.  I will not purchase again nor do I recommend it because who knows how long yours will last.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was looking for a white noise machine for my little one and this was recommended by another mom.Pros:Loud for being so smallLike the different sound optionsPortableEasy to useCons:Charge lasts maybe 2 daysHonestly, I`d expect this thing to last a lot longer. I don`t know if I got a dud but it`s annoying that I have to constantly recharge it every 2 days.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this over the summer and it worked like a dream until it just stopped working. The little light turns on showing it`s charging and or that it`s on, however it stopped making sound. It was only used on weekend trips here and there so probably only used a total of 20 nights since purchased. Pretty disappointed since this is a well known quality brand.","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved everything about this EXCEPT that it stops inconsistently in the middle of the night. I've taken it on three trips now and even though I have made sure it was completely charged for each use, it randomly stops in the middle of the night and has to be plugged in. Although I loved the sounds, volume, and portability, stopping half way through the night is a real disappointment.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love at first sleep. We bought this travel noise machine in March of 2018 (after our 3rd child was born) and kicked ourselves for not buying it sooner...","positive":0},{"review":"  Just tried using this for the first time (ordered it for a vacation) since ordering it one month ago and it is defective. It is fully charged- it plays sound for a minute and turns off. Of course the return window has closed and I can`t return or exchange it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews on Amazon, but I am glad that I purchased this. This is a perfect compact, portable device. You can adjust it to be really loud for when you need that extra loud noise, or turn it really low and soft as well.  I would highly recommend this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  A little mechanical sounding, compared to the standard ROHM plug-in machine. But very lightweight and powerful enough to do the job. Hang it on the door handle of your hotel room, masks sound extremely well with excellent volume, adjustable to project across a large room. Runs at least 8-9 hours, has never lost power after a full charge.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a wonderful little portable white noise machine. My daughter seems to relax as soon as I turn it on. I only wish I would get a little louder, but that`s just me being nit picky. I would definitely buy it again.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been a lifesaver for newborn stage. We like the low loud setting- sounds like the inside of an airplane cabin. And it`s constantly lighting up yellow to let you know it needs charged- which is disturbing for sleep. We put a burp cloth in front of it in the crib for now to block the light.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this product. I first bought the owl one and had to return it because it only worked while plugged into the wall. I love it. I don`t hear the sound loop people complain about in reviews.","positive":1},{"review":"  So glad I purchased this. I`ve been a Dohm user for years and finally invested in the travel size. It has turned off a few times in the middle of the night which isn`t ideal. A longer charged battery life would be appreciated.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is our favorite portable sound machine. We literally bring it everywhere with the baby. We have the Hatch Rest one in her room that we use when she sleep at home but this one goes with us everywhere. It has become my favorite gift to give at baby showers.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just like the standard Marpac noise machine, only little and compact enough for a backpack. My daughter and son-in-law LOVE it. They said the battery lasts about 20 hours before needing a recharge. If you like to sleep in for 10 hours over more than two days, then plug it in.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far, so good.","positive":1},{"review":"  My kids are totally dependant on the white noise. This is an excellent product for car travel or stroller use. It is very adjustable and goes up loud enough to drown out all other noises in the car. I definitely recommend it to others.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great concept, helped my baby sleep in the car WHEN IT WORKED, which it stopped working after a few days. No amount of charging could keep it going.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to love this, but know that it doesn`t work. After placing the order, my first sound machine NEVER worked. It is fully charged. Disappointed and will make sure none of my friends and family purchase this.","positive":0},{"review":"  Surprise surprise. More defective junk from Amazon. I`d like to thank Amazon for yet again having no quality control and allowing cheap Chinese junk to be sold for full retail price. This will be the fifth return I`ve had to make within a month.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like how light and portable this item is, but for the price, I was expecting more noises sounds to choose from. There are only 3 to choose from.  I bought this on sale during Cyber Week, and I'm so glad I did because I probably would have returned it if I had purchased it at full price.  I also like how you can charge it with a USB cable instead of having to replace the batteries.","positive":0},{"review":"  This item worked well for about 2 weeks then stopped turning on most of the time.  It only powers on about 25% of the time that I attempt to use it.  Unreliable junk.","positive":0},{"review":"  This stopped working at 4 months exactly. I`m extremely gentle with it. I`m extremely sad this only worked a couple of months. This one was also not as loud as the one my friend got from the actual site.","positive":0},{"review":"  We've had it for about a month and last night it stopped working correctly. It randomly fluctuates to a higher volume on its own. Apparently it's too late to return it. It's junk.","positive":0},{"review":"  For one of the settings (naturally the one I preferred, the white noise whoosh), there was a persistent ringing in the background which made it impossible not to focus on.  The size, portability and the cordless feature is fantastic for travel.  I returned it.  LOVE the full size Marpac white noise machine, the original.","positive":0},{"review":"  We have both the grey and the white portable sound machines. We bought the grey one and have used it for two years. Which is very unfortunate. I wish I could exchange this one for the grey one but I waited one week too long.","positive":0},{"review":"  This has worked great for the first two months and now into the third month we have noticed that the charge is not as long lasting as it was. Also, for some reason sometimes when we try to turn it up it will change sounds.I think this would be great for travel use, not nighttime and it really does work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this sound machine. It could be a little louder, but I just end up putting it closer to my daughter`s pack n` play. If you unplug and then plug back in, it goes back to charging.But overall it`s been a great little sound machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a great purchase. I'm a Reiki Master and, like a therapist, it's important to have quiet and privacy in my sessions. It's quite versatile. Also note that if you want to charge it while using it, turn it on first and then plug in the adapter wire.","positive":1},{"review":"  We use a Vornado fan in our baby`s room at home. To avoid packing that giant thing, we bought this for vacation and it was PERFECT. We just plugged it in thru the day to recharge and it worked all night. Baby slept perfectly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can now sleep much better thanks to the lovely waves you hear from this machine.  .esp. if you have any ringing in the ears like me).","positive":1},{"review":"  I use it every day. Great for my baby while I`m shopping and he naps in his car seat with it. Love that it`s rechargeable. I had a battery one in the past and I was spending a lot on batteries because I used it so often.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great for folks who need a constant white noise to sleep. Good range of volume settings and all 3 sound options are perfect. Much easier for travel than a fan. I would recommend this to anyone without hesitation.","positive":1},{"review":"  I used this white noise for filtering distracting noise for my son during nursing or bedtime. We take it everywhere with us. I have charged it all night and now can`t turn it on. It has not been a year, do you do replacement within a year.","positive":1},{"review":"  Wow. This thing is a work horse, seriously.. Legit would not travel anywhere without this thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  A Great Purchase.. And even though it's smaller than I expected when I purchased it online, the size is perfect for our baby's crib- I just looped it on the corner & it stays out of the way while baby is sleeping. Totally worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was even more useful than I expected. I initially bought it as a travel white noise machine to take on a trip, intending to put it in a child's room. The charging setup is ideal for travel because a plug or converter isn't necessarily needed. I saw that others have asked, so I'll answer: yes, the USB end can go in to an iPhone charger and plug into an outlet that way.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am beyond disappointed in this product. We have both the big Marpac noise machine and this travel one. I even keep it plugged in during the baby`s naps during the day. I love our original Marpac and had high hopes for this one but I am so disappointed and will be looking for another option.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really thought this was going to be perfect for travel and I did take it on a trip.  But it has an \"under sound\", that comes through the white sound and it is more annoying than soothing.  I had to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The charge doesn`t last very long. Replaced my battery one with this for less waste and honestly were charging it one to two times a day. It`s been hard to get used to it dying so fast compared to the two weeks it would take our battery operated one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`m so disappointed. I have a marpac sound machine and it`s great but this portable one the on button takes forever of continuing to press it to get it to turn on.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had high hopes but I`m so disappointed. 1. We have to keep it plugged in all the time ( and the light blinks when it needs recharged even when it`s continuously plugged in) . We tried to take it camping and on the second night it started turning itself off even though it had plenty of battery left.","positive":0},{"review":"  Our baby loves her sound machine in her nursery, so we purchased *this* sound machine to take on a big cross country trip with her.  It worked for two days of our trip and then it stopped working. It then would turn on and off randomly without anyone touching it or near it. This was a huge disappointment.","positive":0},{"review":"  Total piece of junk. I`ve had it for 6 months, used probably 10 times total and none of the buttons work. I had to wrap it in a blanket and hide it in a closet so it didn`t wake up my whole house. What a waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broken after 2 months and return window is closed. Lame. None of the buttons work and wouldn`t turn off. Had to wait until the battery ran out to finally escape the sound.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worst part is it can't be returned to Amazon.  I called tech support and they were unable to help. Amazon won't accept return within 2 days or receipt.  $30 down the toilet.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to improve my 4 month old`s sleep quality however it seems to make things worse. It just stops working all of a sudden and wakes him up from his sleep...","positive":0},{"review":"  If you are looking for powerful fan sound for white noise in compact form, this is it.. And I only used 1 2 the level of volume. You will not regret this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I do love that it provides the exact replication of the sound in the non-travel size units. (And even louder.) However, the charge doesn't last longer than one night and I can't figure out a way to run it while it is plugged in. So it's super as long as you have the option to re-charge it every day or two.","positive":1},{"review":"  My favorite sound machine. Purchased this a second time for our newest baby. It`s small and portable for babies car seat carrier, we even took it to the hospital when he was born and it helped drown out all the hospital noises which helped mom and dad sleep better too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like the sound options for this. They are a nice deep white noise and a more high pitched white noise. I plan to use this on an upcoming vacation. This is a nice small size, easily portable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I originally purchased the Marpac Dohm Classic but it wasn't nearly loud enough. This little baby is so much louder and smaller. It's not a deal breaker but just a slight annoyance. Still love it overall.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good quality and I love the usb charge but if you use it all night it has to be charged daily. Also I had to cover the light with tape it blinks when the battery is low and is like a strobe light in the room.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've used a white noise machine for 30 years now.  This is the first o e that I've purchased that is electronic rather than machanical that actually makes the fan noise that sounds right.  It's great to have a unit that sounds the way I want it to that I can easily take with me on trips.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a must have unit if you are a light sleeper. Great for travel. My entire family is hooked on this small device. You can not hear the elevator noise, people slamming doors or the next door guest.","positive":1},{"review":"  I used this when I went on a trip and stayed in an airbnb and had to sleep next to my cousin who was snoring. This machine not only drowned out her snores but also drowned out my feelings of sleeping in a new place. It lasted all night (8 hours) and I was able to adjust the volumes easily. It's small yet powerful.","positive":1},{"review":"  We can't live without it. Battery lasts all night and gets nice and loud if needed. My old noise machine burned through batteries. We keep this plugged in at home but if traveling lasts long without plugged in.","positive":1},{"review":"  While this worked, it was great.  Plenty loud, portable, etc.  I tried to contact Marpac, but their customer service wasn't good.  A bummer, as we own a ton of their products.","positive":0},{"review":"  The performance of this product is incredible and so compact.  Looks really great and cute hanging in my bathroom.  I was provided the return shipping label and was instructed to use the same box.  It was very simple to swap it out.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really loved this in the beginning, but we have to keep it plugged in all the time to last more than five minutes. However, when while plugged in it will turn off in the middle of the night waking up my littleOne and defeating the purpose of using...","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing worked for us for a while but than it turns out the off on button stopped working so the only way it shuts off is to let the battery wear out. I would return it if the window hadn't closed on me...","positive":0},{"review":"  Not impressed with this machine at all \u2014 none of the buttons work as intended, and are highly unreliable at best. Only way I can get the thing to turn off is by holding the power button down for a good minute, which causesthe volume to increase incrementally to its highest capacity before ultimately turning off. All are problematic. Do not recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  It says this is non-looping, but it has a repeating electronic sound that I find really difficult to listen to. If the volume is turned down low enough it doesn't bother me too much, but then it sort of defeats the purpose of the white noise machine to block out other sounds...","positive":0},{"review":"  I actually did like this product alot when we first got it and used it often for my newborn, but within one month, the noise machine would no longer take a charge rendering it useless. We have tried time and time again to get it to work but it is simply dead. What a waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is amazing however I can only give it three stars because the battery in ours dies after a few hours of use. After being fully charged, it has cut off multiple times in the middle of the night, causing our 11 week old baby to wake up. Aside from battery, the volume control and sound quality are excellent. Our baby goes to sleep instantly when we turn it on (then we just cross our fingers it doesn`t die).","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this on June 2019. I loved it. It only worked for 4-5 months m. That`s terrible.","positive":0},{"review":"  We really loved this. However, it barely lasts one night before we have to charge it again. Now at 5 months, it lasts 8 hours, then we have to charge it during wake times.It lasts 8 hours, so I'm not completely upset with it, I just got spoiled without having to charge it so often.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am one of those people that cannot sleep without a fan white noise. I found the domn and take them everywhere I go. It also has several volume settings which gives you several options which I love. Great product, highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  Best white noise machine ever. We have two. One for home and one for daycare. So nice that it has a battery because when the power goes out it just keeps playing in the nursery so no sleep interruptions.","positive":1},{"review":"  Iv been using this every nap and night for my kiddo for 2 years almost. It`s easy to charge and take with you if needed. My other kids have asked for one because they love the sound as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had concerns about whether the volume would be as high as the full size versions of this product. I was surprised to find it worked just fine. Very nice for travel, especially internationally where different walk plugs are required, since it charges off of USB. Good battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very good travel sound machine.Wish it came with its own converter for charging. Does not last all night on battery at higher volume levels, so we just leave it plugged in.FYI, have to hold power button for a long time to turn on.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love love love this for on the go noise machine with our baby girl.","positive":1},{"review":"  Have you ever stayed in a hotel with kids running up and down the hall ways, adults after too many beverages trying to find their room, the annoying a c clicking noise that will not stop.  If you answered yes to any of these, then the Marpac Rohm Portable is your answer.  The product is compact in size, offers a variety of sounds for the price, it is user friendly and holds a charge for several nights. Try it.","positive":1},{"review":"  We purchased this for our son while I was pregnant based on a recommendation. It has been such a blessing. It was easy to set up and control. Great for traveling as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the perfect white noise machine. It has 3 different options which is great because I hate the standard white noise. It's loud enough for him to hear, but not so loud that everyone else hears it. It holds a charge for a while too.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for infant and LOVE IT. We have traveled a fair amount this summer and no matter where we are, as long as we have this our baby has no problems going nite nite. When he sleeps in a room with us, I feel like I get better sleep as well. We only use the white noise option though.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased 2 - 1 works fine. The other one has an audible click every 6 seconds when the loop starts over. Doesn`t seem to bother the kids though. Seems to hold a charge all night - I`d say we`ve been able to get 12-13 hours use before the next charge is needed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great for traveling and naps at grandmas so we don`t have to pack his regular, larger sound machine. But I actually don`t like this one all too much because it always turns on while it`s in the diaper bag. Kind of annoying but it functions well.","positive":0},{"review":"  The item arrived on time and appeared to be in good condition, but after the first use the buttons seemed to not work consistently. After the 2nd use the on off button stuck in the on position and only the volume controls work. The button to switch between the 3 types of white noise isn`t consistent and sometimes works but usually does not. Overall, poorly functioning product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Only downside is if you don`t charge fully or leave plugged in it could die in the middle of the night. If you plug in you`re fine and it is tiny & compact. Sometimes doesn`t take a charge. No idea what is happening or if I`m doing something wrong but I find it highly unreliable to use all night when traveling (and when I am in most need of a white noise machine).","positive":0},{"review":"  I absolutely loved this sound machine. I bought three. Very frustrating. If you have one that works it`s great.","positive":0},{"review":"  Item did not work properly after several full charges. When I turned it on, it only goes for a short while and then shuts off after the third or fourth time it only lasted for 5 seconds and shut off after being charged all night. I called support and Amazon is exchanging and replacing the item for no charge. I will leave a second review on the replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this for 8 months and it was working great. But then it just stopped working. I also didn't love (when it was working) that you had to hold the buttons down to turn it on, there was a delay and it was a but annoying. something I could deal with when it worked, but worth mentioning now.","positive":0},{"review":"  The annoying thing about this product is you can`t turn it on if it`s plugged in. If it is charged, you turn it on and when the battery wears out, you have to charge it, unplug it, and then turn it on. Majorly inconvenient. I do like that it has a rechargeable battery.","positive":0},{"review":"  Buttons quit working  after about a month of use. I have to let the battery run completely out, then charge it up again for it to work properly. It has happened multiple times in the short time I've used it. Otherwise I love the sound,  I love that it is portable and that it is rechargeable.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've bought several of these before and had great luck with them. I recently purchased another item and it's clearly defective. Also, the sound setting button has started changing the volume instead of the type of noise. Really disappointed that I can no longer return this clearly defective item.","positive":0},{"review":"  My 17 month old grandson has white noise to sleep with. He does not speak yet, but will point to it at nap or bedtime to remind me to turn it on.","positive":1},{"review":"  This white noise device is great.  I have had others before (light sleeper) but you can generally hear when the sound loop begins again.  Fits nicely and since it runs on a charge, no wires to get in the way.  Affordable, so I bought an extra to keep in my suitcase for travel.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this portable sound machine. Works great for our 4. The sounds available are great for newborns as well. The charge lasts a while and can be used the entire night without dying.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this. Straightforward, easy to use, great volume, portable. Will go all night on a charge no problem. Not so much with the hush.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is so amazing. I learned about it being a baby. It`s amazing. I highly recommend it especially if you`re a light sleeper it helps relax you and have a better nights rest.","positive":1},{"review":"  Can not believe I didn`t get this with my first. She`s two years old and still uses a sound machine but I decided to purchase for my newborn and easily one of my top 5 favorite products.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you have a newborn you honestly need this. It`s a lifesaver when traveling or when your kiddo just needs decreased stimulation during tummy time.","positive":1},{"review":"  The best things: it creates more sound than you'd expect and really does have a long battery life. However, you have no idea how much battery is left at a given moment and, weirdly, you cannot turn it on if it is charging (though it will continue to make sound if you plug it in while it is on). Otherwise, great.","positive":1},{"review":"  Really confused by all the negative feed back. This portable sound machine is great. Which maybe the reason for negative feed back. Invest in the non portable white noise machine for at home.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for white noise for my newborn. She loves it for sleep. 3 sounds-waves and regular white noise. The deep white noise isn`t our favorite and would never use but I`m guessing some people like it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The sound is ok, it's what you pay for. The volume control is pretty good. When plugged in, sometimes the power buttons don't work. I like it fine when it's working but a couple days of usage I started noticing that it randomly shuts off or has issues with the power button.","positive":0},{"review":"  Stopped working after just 7 weeks. It`s convenient and portable.

Great for traveling.","positive":1},{"review":"  I didnt realize that this thing *cannot* take traditional batteries, and that it doesnt even come with it's own charger. Very annoying.

I'm going to be returning mine.","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved the size and effectiveness of this sound machine. It had a good variety of sounds and volumes and really helped my baby sleep well. It was great for naps, but for a full night it had to be plugged in to work.

I purchased it months before our baby arrived and didn`t open it until a few months after, once he made his appearance.

I`m so disappointed in the sound machine and now am going to have to purchase another brand ASAP.","positive":0},{"review":"  We loved this sound machine as did our new baby, however, after 2 months of use the buttons stopped working and the machine is broken. We could not properly turn on or off, increase or decrease the sound or change the tone of the machine.

Such a bummer because this is not a cheap gadget.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am HIGHLY disappointed with this product. I`ve only had it for about 5 months, and it will shut off about 2 hours into use even if it`s plugged in.

I hope you enjoy your Pocket 2 as much as I am.","positive":1},{"review":"  For those with a GPD Pocket 1, here's a quick first-impressions comparison:SCREEN: Pretty much the same quality screen with the same unimpressive brightness.

I paid over 950 dollars for this and regretting it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Out the box, this unit did not charge.  I read the only other review and they had a similar issue, so I played around.

Lots of ports and the industry standard USB C charging.The unusual pointing system, with the sensor above the keyboard on the right and the mouse buttons on the left side takes a bit of getting used to, but it is very convenient once you get used to it, especially if you are hand holding the unit.

The resolution is fine but the colors are not very saturated or crisp.I didn't purchase this expecting it to be a powerhouse, so I'm generally satisfied, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a device with great performance.","positive":0},{"review":"  Item returned because programs constantly froze.","positive":0},{"review":"  Too small-can hardly see things-possibly returning for larger screen laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I  bought this little PC for a specific purpose and I'm going to keep it, but I wanted to install a 256 Gig SSD drive in place of the 64 Gigs it comes with.  Unfortunately the memory is eMMC memory.  Don't bother with any other available backup programs.  I tried several of them.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to travel with and do paperwork on. It worked great for that purpose. I don`t know how it would be for gaming, etc. it`s very light weight and yet the keyboard was comfortable to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this computer because it came with the Microsoft suite -- which costs nearly as much as this computer that came WITH the suite already installed. My only complaint is that it came with an operating system that will not allow you to download programs unless you change the operating system. Just know that when you change the system, you cannot change it back. The screen is clear and the size makes it extremely portable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed a work machine and did not want to spend very much. I'm amazed at how good this laptop is the for the low price. The year of free MS Office 365 was the capper for me and I decided to buy it after researching several other models under $250. A month after my purchase, I am very happy with it, and I feel that I got the best laptop for the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a huge fan of Chromebook but I need to download some apps. This little laptop has many of the same great features as Chromebook with some added capabilities, at a very reasonable price. I always strip off Windows and install the Cinnamon distro of Linux Mint. That speeds it up a lot.","positive":1},{"review":"  Have had it for a year and it is still going strong. No real issues except for the normal glitches you get with a computer, and just restart it and good to go. But if you need a laptop for normal everyday use it gets the job done. The hard drive will fill up fast if you are downloading so be prepared to have a separate Passport to store things on.","positive":1},{"review":"  I travel often and wanted a smaller, lighter laptop to take with me.

My son uses this laptop for Smart Music for school and we use it for browsing the web or playing games on the internet, checking email, occasionally typing up a document.

Less than two months after receiving it, it refused to boot up. I am disgusted. Was this really a new laptop, or secretly refurbished.","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price it's a decent little laptop. I don't review many computers so not many points to compare. It has a few hiccups in performance(it is not a top of the line computer), and more problems than expected(when cu is why I didn't give the fifth star) but overall a decent cheap laptop and does what I needed it for.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is good for a basic laptop. The issue with Windows s was simple to fix I Google the procedure and it was a some click of the mouse to get rid of Windows s. Then I upgraded it to Windows 10 pro.

I am getting one for my self too. However, the price went up a little.","positive":1},{"review":"  Comes with Windows S - very limited - setup FORCES you to use login credentials, including choosing a phone number and birthdate, and if you were born in 1953, like me, you have to CLICK (not scroll) a bunch of times to get to your birth year --- Pretty much deciding to send these things (bought 2 of them) back for refund, IF I can get that.(Normally setup allows you to bypass the \"use Microsoft ID\" nonsense - this is WAY too restrictive)I figured out how to get it out of \"S\" mode, and set it up as an actual laptop.  I WISH the product description were more informative about this, but I'm editing this review to change the star rating from 1 to 4, because AFTER getting it out of \"S\" mode, it's a GREAT little laptop for what I needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop a month ago for my daughter for her to do her school work (research & Microsoft office) and to just browse the internet and it is working excellent...it would awesome if it had a CD DVD drive but apart fro the it is a great laptop for its price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Muy \u00fatil para tareas sencillasSe transporta f\u00e1cilmente.Duraci\u00f3n de  Bater\u00eda aceptable (puedo decir varios d\u00edas us\u00e1ndola intermitentemente) (3 -4 horas us\u00e1ndola interrumpidamente con videos, m\u00fasica , etc)Se navega y se abren los programas fluidamente.

I don't do anything heavy mostly typing documents and looking at excel sheets so this was perfect for me. This very light and easy the carry around swear I left it a couple of times due to weight.","positive":1},{"review":"  The size and weight is a dream. It's probably not the fastest laptop I've owned as far as surfing but it's not too bad. Ideal for writing, light surfing, and putting on Netflix as you work. The battery life lasts for nearly four hours, too.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was perfect for my needs.  I wanted something smaller and lighter to use in bed following hip surgery. when I'm in my bedroom.  I would recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  No complains. Don`t expect a high performer but good enough for everyday work. Instead buy yourself an SD Card and instal it in the computer.

Doing an Amazon return.","positive":0},{"review":"  I do like this laptop however, there`s not enough storage.

I`m debating on if I should return it so I can get my money back to buy a better laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop itself is not that bad but the only reason I gave it a low rating is because of the horrible horrible software of windows 10. I was on the phone for over an hour with Microsoft customer service and they were unable to help me.","positive":0},{"review":"  Slow & makes me super nervous... Not the stability i need in a laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  You get what you pay for. it does the job but dont expect good sound or a good webcam. I have to jack it up to 125%. All and all, I wish I would have spent more for a better machine.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love my little laptop. I got it mainly to link the internet to my big screen TV for streaming and it does well. I hate it because I spilled a tiny bit of coffee on the keyboard and it screwed up it up. It still works but I can't use the keyboard, and they don't pay for screw-ups.","positive":0},{"review":"  Definitely a slower laptop, for only word processing or browsing the web - casual streaming even - and a great value for the price. It comes with Windows S (a version of Windows that only installs apps from the Microsoft store which does not have Google Chrome or anything useful really) but it can be turned off easily.0 drives because this computer can't take advantage of it. A regular version of Windows now takes up a good portion of space, I personally got a 64 Gb USB drive and it works great with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far so good.  Got this for my wife about a month ago, and I have a slightly older model.  Perfect for our needs which usually does not involve streaming.  Pretty basic model but looks like excellent quality and is a great value.","positive":1},{"review":"  this is not a laptop, it is a ideapad with windows 10s. basically it can be used in windows mode (limited) or pad mode.  this description needs to be corrected by the seller because now im stuck with this unit which is still usable but not what i intended to use it for.","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn't have a lot of money to spend and I needed something more than a chrome book.  These appear to be good quality. I've had other Lenovo products and have been pleased with them and this is no exception. It's on the small side but for the price it's a good deal.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall this notebook is a nice addition to any arsenal in today's technology.  It does the basic things very well.  For me this was important while in Italy and at the same time communication with family and friends. I would highly recommend the Lenovo 130S as I am very happy with my purchase and I think you would be too.","positive":1},{"review":"  The one I purchased is not a touch screen but it`s still holding up. I purchased it some time last year and it`s still up and running as of June 2020.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to replace an old MacBook I highjacked to run Windows 7 that died.

Don't expect it to do much else besides that. But for the price you can't really go wrong.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer is worth the price. It`s cheap and works well. Just need a wireless or wired mouse. It`s light, screen is average, and it`s battery life is better than I thought it would be.","positive":1},{"review":"  If your reading this, I'll simply say the other reviews about this machine being laggy were spot on, don't buy it.

She plays her games and does school work. She is hard on electronics and klutzy but she hasn`t had any issues with this device.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love, love this laptop.  It's super lightweight and easy to carry around.  It has everything you need for school at a great price. It even comes with a one year subscription to Microsoft Office.","positive":1},{"review":"  So to start this off, I'm a gamer. I have a gaming laptop, but it feels like it weighs about ten pounds, and its a massive piece of tech.The only downside I've had is heat the bottom of the laptop generates while in use and charging at the same time.Overall, I love it and would recommend it for the average user looking for a laptop to type and do schooling on.","positive":1},{"review":"  I did not buy this from Amazon, but direct from BestBuy. however, it is a great notebook computer.  Gave this only 4 stars for \"Material quality\" since it's an all-plastic notebook.  Tradeoff is the featherweight.","positive":1},{"review":"  Screen resolution is obviously not great. Factory-installed memory is low, but for a few extra bucks a microSD essentially fixes that. I've done it twice now, as I bought a 2nd of these for the missus. She loves the light weight.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little laptop. Boots up fast, does what it's supposed to.Changing from Windows 10 S to reg. Windows 10 home is free, easy to do & allows you to download Chrome or whatever else you want, but I do recommend an SD card as there isn't much room on the laptop itself.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very happy with the size, portability, battery life and keyboard. Speed and boot times are excellent. Took almost an hour. Not a big deal, just something to be aware of.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this so I could do school work. Honestly for $200 it is a good computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  First I have to say that I am very impressed with this laptop. I opted for the Asus 11.Wifi: Very strong connectionAll in all: I highly recommend this laptop if you are on a budget and looking for a machine for school or office work. I'm very happy with it and for the price it is absolutely worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this as a replacement for my fathers Chromebook. As much as he loved the size and weight of that computer, he could never move himself away from Microsoft, especially since all his previous work had been done in office. Perfect for basic browsing, vid streaming, IP calls and viewing editing office docs.Great value for money if one takes the time to setup properly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love Asus. My all-day every day computer is a 17 inch Asus laptop.  I can't rate the battery life yet, but it seems to be excellent.  My 17\" Asus has very good battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  just a little user-adaptability learning curve.. because it's like a silent partner that is extremely portable and lightweight. lightning speed.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is not bad for the price. It runs fine enough, but keep in mind that the storage capacity is low so do not plan to download lots of files, apps, or games, and it is passively cooled so it will get hot really quick. It does NOT support a SIM or eSIM.  I hope this helps.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this simply to do school work at home. Problem is our school system works on Google and this software would not let me download Chrome because \"Windows 10 is now the fastest. finally, they connected me to the manufacturer. Asus's response: we can not alter the setup, so in short I was stuck with something I could not download Google on.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love Asus.  I've had three other Asus laptops.  If you need a fully functioning PC that you can install things like Office, iTunes, etc. onto, then forget it, this will just not work for you.","positive":0},{"review":"  Loathe this product and I wish I had done more research prior to purchasing. Do not let the price point fool you, woeful Millennial, for I fell pray and man did I screw up. AVOID. AVOID.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very nice computer I got it for one thing and that`s just to use iTunes to connect my phone or my iPad to it to physically wiped out data on my iPhone and iPad and just use it for software updates on my phone and tablet it seems the computer was pretty fast at set up but I uninstalled all the apps that came in it and then it popped up saying I need to restart for it to fix any disc errors it restarted the update and did the scan and then it went back to the welcome screen typed in my four digit pin and then it takes about two minutes for it to login I understand this is aVery low-end computer but I don`t expect it to take two minutes to login.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this so I could travel with it if I need to. (Try traveling with a full sized laptop its heavy as hell. Also for those reading this everything else in my house the full laptop's, desk top's, phones, and tablets as well connect to the internet just fine. Just know you have been warned about the issue and how crappy Asus can be with there help.","positive":0},{"review":"  I can't believe this thing gets to many good reviews.  Memory is so small that you can barely do anything.  I may allow you to store more documents and pictures, but it won't solve the overall operating of the system.  The only think this is good for is maybe watching youtube videos.","positive":0},{"review":"  I spent hours on the phone with Amazon tech support (who were great), Asus tech support who were TERRIBLE and Microsoft tech support. Microsoft spent hours with me trying to get this laptop out of S Mode. It was NOT disclosed that the system was Microsoft Windows 10 in S Mode. I consider that a failure on Amazon`s part.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer comes with Windows 10 S, which I cannot recommend using. I believe Windows requires too much drive space and processing power to work well on a laptop like this one.I want to be able to recommend this computer because it's a great price, a great size, and really is all the average user needs (assuming you switch to some version of Linux) but I really can't because of the hardware issues. If you've made it this far and want my advice, I strongly believe you can get a much better laptop by spending just a little more (maybe $50 to $100 more).","positive":0},{"review":"  I knew as soon as I opened this laptop it was not what I expected. Very bulky and uncomfortable for your hand placement. Nine must have been defective because I could barley get through the sign up process the lagging was unbearbale. Tried to use it for a few days but defiently not worth the price or up to compatibility for it to have been a Icore 3.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got this for my kids for school. So far so good.  Very small and lightweight.  I plan to purchase another one so they each have their own.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I paid $200, wish I waited and saved 25-% but lesson learned. Next time I`ll stick with used.6 and budget..","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this as a second (portable) laptop for limited application at work. I really like the weight and ease of use. But that's my problem, not the laptop's. I would recommend this to anyone who has basic computing needs and wants a lightweight computer to travel with ease.","positive":1},{"review":"  this is a cheap, lite weight laptop. its not very powerful and doesn't have a lot of storage...","positive":1},{"review":"  My hands do not work well so I thought I would try a smaller laptop.  This laptop is a real help to me.  The screen quality is very good and even at the small size works well.  The only draw back for me is the speakers seem weak but that may be my hearing.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm extremely upset. I got this for my son for Christmas and already it's not working. On the phone now with Tech support for Asus \ud83e\udd2c. What a disappointment.","positive":1},{"review":"  My  son  has  this  as  part  of  his  graduation  present  from  Elementary  school.  As  he  begins  Middle school  this  fall  he'll  be  prepared  with  his  own  laptop  to  do all  his  reports  with  plenty  of  memory  stored.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was actually shocked as to how small it is but it can work. First, keep in mind that it comes with WINDOWS 10S which is a security feature that can only allow you to download apps within Microsoft App store and not via third party. But not to worry, you can convert it back to the normal Windows 10 in the settings feature which is what I did. Otherwise, it is smooth running and has a good battery life and also lightweight.","positive":1},{"review":"  Don't expect much from the build quality, and this is a great value.  As long as you don't care about things like viewing angle on the screen, or color accuracy, or design quality, this very basically does what a PC can do, its a useful utility, and it even feels durable.  For the price, its sort of amazing.  But it doesn't compare to more well designed laptops.","positive":1},{"review":"  With the influx of Smart Phones, when the day arrived that our 10 year old laptop needed to be replaced, I really had to think if it made sense to do so.After thinking this over, smart phones are great but can they do everything...","positive":1},{"review":"  This has Windows 10S, which is in the cloud, NOT Windows 10, as advertised. Windows 10 isn't even on this computer...","positive":0},{"review":"  I love that it is lightweight, small, and perfect for travel.  I am a Windows user so having Office preinstalled was a plus.  It is not a Zoom problem because this never happens when I am on my desktop computer sitting at the same desk, using the same internet connection as this Asus computer.  So if you need to Zoom - zoom away from this computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  Its a good little laptop for the price but the hard drive is misleading. It is a 32gb hd, however from the factory it is almost full. I ended up having to purchase an external hd for videos of my kids soccer games, each one takes up 3-4gb. rating is solely based on that.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought two for my girlfriend and her daughter to do school work.  One of them works fine,  the other however just stopped.  Would have given one star if it were just for the one computer, two for both but a star is deserved for tech support.  It was really easy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Guess I should have read the comments. I wanted this for a specific program and knew I couldn`t have a Windows 10S and saw it was listed as only windows 10 and eagerly ordered it. just to find out it was windows S which is not compatible with the program I needed. Should be in the discription that it`s 10 S.","positive":0},{"review":"  At the beginning this was a cute little laptop and worked fine.  About a month later it started to turn off and freeze.  After three months this no longer turned on any more.  I am extremely dissatisfied as I wanted to use this for school but had to buy a whole new laptop else where.","positive":0},{"review":"  I BOUGHT THIS DEVICE AND ITS BEEN AN HEADACHE THE WINDOWS THAT CAME WITH IT HAD AN ERROR WHEN INSTALLED FROM THERE ITS BEEN GOING DOWNHILL ITS A GOOD THING MY BROTHER KNOWS ABOUT COMPUTERS AND HOW TO FIX IT....","positive":0},{"review":"  This started out well, for the first five minutes. After set up was complete I was unable to install any basic apps and was prompted to restart as an error had occurred. Asus used to be a pretty reputable name, however their products of late have severely lacked in quality. I`m no long an Asus customer.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for my uncle who was visiting from out of country.  My fault for not powering it up before he left cause it was dead out of the box.  It will not start up and all he gets is a blue screen with a few options to go into recovery mode, but nothing happens when he selects the different options. I possibly got a defective comp right out of the box.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this computer 2 years ago and it worked well for 1 year. Then it starts telling me that I have low disk space so I uninstalled all my applications and it doesn't even free up space. Ever since I got the computer I have ran fresh start 5 times. I do not recommend this computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price, this laptop is about the best you can get. Asus never disappoints. I use mine for tracking my Dungeons & Dragons character sheet and notes in game, and for light internet surfing and writing while waiting or riding. This would be perfect for a student, writer, or tabletop gamer on a budget like me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed this just for minor school and business also this is great for anyone who just using it for minimal task work dont expect this to play modern games but i did test it for emulators work frekin great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I read the reviews before I purchased this laptop and I agree that it is a great laptop.  It was easy to set up and I am very satisfied with its quality and function.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed something I could do work from home on.  This was a perfect solution.maybe, never compared the two. I do recommend a wireless mouse as I am not fond of the whole scrolling square.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this item for Email, and Simple game play, and news and reading my newspapers.  It was beneficial that I read the ccomment's on the description page, which is where I learned this is a Chrome OS, with the upgrade to Windows 10 option.  Its fast, and good response, and the battery is sufficient, but does wane somewhat quickly.  I like this Laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop so I could remote in to my main pc when I'm away from home so I can work on games, apps, and programs and provided my internet where I am is good enough I can use my home desktop with no problems whatsoever.The screen quality is pretty good provided you're not angled to far where at which point it becomes saturated and can get a negative tint if your angle is too great for the threshold.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great budget laptop. There are some drawbacks to it like the battery life not being quite as amazing as my Chromebook. I usually get 4-5 hours on a full charge which is not bad. Laptop can lag at times, but overall not too bad for the price point.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this just for browsing the web. It is lightning fast and performs better than expected. I knew this when I purchased it however and I have no other complaints. Besides, I only paid $160 for this.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am not writing a bad review the table was a bit smaller than I expected. Overall I love it was supposed to be  11.6 and it was a 10.","positive":1},{"review":"  The computer is a little smaller than what I'm used to, but it didn't take long for me to get used to the smaller size.  It's very light weight which I really like.  I wish the battery life was a little longer, but that's a small inconvenience.  Overall I love this computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  After 30 days Warranty expired. Product worked well enough for a while, then screen died after 4 months. Asus could probably fix, but the fee doesnt make it worthwhile.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works fine, can't install google and thanks to the endless updates from windows the laptop is full and it only has 15 word docs on it.

It appears we have no return options either.  Very disappointed, as is my 10 year old son, who spent his Christmas money on this computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  Let's face it. These things are cheap for a reason.  The screenshot from Amazon is not acceptable.Don't buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer is fine if you plan to use it for email and crafting documents, but it is not good for much else.

Fits my needs, Highly Recommended..","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s nice. I really only use it to check my email or shop and the occasional document and it`s very responsive and fast.

As others have mentioned, it does run really hot - as in warm.  But I can play games like World of Warcraft with max graphics, and even have two instances open at the same time and it's a beast.  And it's really light if you are going to be toting it around.","positive":1},{"review":"  This computer lags a bit with some games (granted, so far, the game it lags with most is five years old and wasn't coded well) but most importantly, I had to spend an additional $200 on a replacement power cord right out of the gate, because the one that came with the computer was very much the wrong one and wouldn't charge the laptop. I also was advised to buy a new battery, just in case, which I did.Overall, four stars, once I figured out how to turn off auto-brightness, which was not even LISTED AN OPTION but was SOMEHOW turned on, and turned off the battery-affected system downgrades, which defeats the purpose of the battery to start with. If I wanted a computer that only really works when it's plugged in, I would have bought a desktop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just recieved this today, but my best friend has had hers for almost a year now and lets me do some editing with it.

I went with the MSI Creator 15M because it ended up having better specs then most of the gaming laptops of the same price range.

Sound works now and of course everything else too out of the box.","positive":1},{"review":"  While the system cooling leaves a bit to be desired, the performance of both the CPU and GPU makes up for it. Editing in Premiere Pro and After Effects is no longer the painful, time consuming process it used to be.It doesn't have the rock-solid feel of the Dell laptop I used to use, but I don't have to be too concerned about exceeding the weight limit for carry-on bags on international flights, and use the improved weight budget for another lens or just to give my back a break.","positive":1},{"review":"  Todo excelente solo que el cup\u00f3n de regalo no le funciono ni reclamando.","positive":1},{"review":"  Havent ran into any of the problems other people have ran into.

I rely upon the comments and experiences of other consumers when making an Amazon purchasing decision. Thank you.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this sleeve for my 13in MacBook Pro. I think it's a nice quality product for the low price I paid. The MacBook charger and cord fit perfectly in this pouch.Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable, slim-fitting sleeve for your MacBook Pro.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th Gen, which is a 14\" laptop. I first purchased the 14-15\" version of this case, but there was way too much extra room in the case. I have reordered the 13.3\" version despite the fact that it was still a little loose, and hopefully this one won't come with a \"dent\" in the side.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this sleeve for the purpose of protection in my tote and the elements on my daily commute. The product is described well in the review and I found those statements to be very accurate. It will dissipate within a few hours or days.

I have a 2017 13 inch MacBook Pro, and I don't put any case on my MacBook (or on my iPhone for that matter). I wish the fit was even more snugger, and as others have mentioned, it does have a strong smell of off-gas (chemical), but I'm sure it'll dissipate soon enough. Overall, I recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Soft stretchy material. The HP Spectre x360 fits nicely with enough room to hold the little case inside. Would like to see a couple of hidden handles or a detachable shoulder strap on the next version. Overall, very happy with purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is amazing and has saved my laptop on more than one occasion. I bought it many months ago but was inspired to write a review two days ago after walking 20 minutes in a rain and thunderstorm without an umbrella. The outside of the case is a little stained from what I've put it through, and I have not tried to clean it, but it doesn't bother me at all. The quality is truly outstanding.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my Surface Pro 6, and it fits perfectly, even with the pen stuck to the side.  This is neoprene, but it didn't stink when I opened the package, which was really nice.And I am so not going to drop my Surface in it to see how well it protects it.  I'm pretty sure a fall of farther than a few inches won't end well, but this is padded enough that I'm not worried about my toy getting scratched up in my backpack.","positive":1},{"review":"  Super happy with this purchase. I bought this to protect my laptop when I travel or bring it to work.  Am I right.  You know I am.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this laptop case because I really liked the shade of pink offered by this company.  It arrived today and looks nothing like the picture.  When you scroll through all the pictures on Amazon and look really close at the border compared to the middle, you can kind of see the shade difference, but it`s way more pronounced in real life and not visible at all in the main display picture.  I`m very disappointed and will be returning this item.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop bag about 3 months ago. I have given little use to it, once or twice per week at most. What appears to be a bargain at first glance turns out to be an expensive experience. Do yourself, and your pocket, a favor and look somewhere else for your laptop bag needs.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered the 13\" for the new MBP touch bar and was hoping for a similar fit to the 2010 InCase MBP neoprene sleeve.The perimeter of the sleeve is good and tight when aligned to the computer, but the sides are not fitted at all.  You can tell the sleeve is designed to offer some impact resistance at the corners, but it wasn't fabricated well enough to do so.A less important annoyance is that the perimeter is a snug fit, but the fabric hem right inside of the zipper does not protrude much either, so it's difficult to zip up without rubbing the computer against the zipper.","positive":0},{"review":"  OK, this was supposed to be the 13-13.3 compatible case. This fit neither of those desires. will return immediately.","positive":0},{"review":"  This review is about the baby pink version.I was really sad when I learned that water actually stains this case, because I otherwise really like the build of the case and its pretty original.If I had somehow been able to know this without staining it, I would have returned it beforehand. Buyer beware, at least for the baby pink version.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the gray case and it stains super easy.  Very quickly after I opened the package, I noticed it was stained. Now there are water stains on my new case.  While I must say these look like fantastic cases - the quality of the zipper and plush inside are really nice, the quality of the materials are quickly overshadowed by how easily this get stained.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was very disappointed upon receiving this product. I bought it for my brand new MacBook Air 13\" computer along with a hard shell of the same brand. It also came with a slight \"scar\" on the outside.

Since that night, I have kept the sleeve and pouch outside for three days to let it air out, but the smell is still extremely noticeable. I will return the product if the smell doesn`t improve after five days, because I definitely don`t want the smell to transfer to the inside of my bag.","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price, this case (with its accompanying pouch for accessories) is a real buy.Fits my 13\" MacBook Air with ease, zips nicely and is plenty durable.  Having a pouch that easily accommodates the outlet plug and multiple USB drives (with room to spare) is a definite plus.  I would definitely buy this again if the need arose.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this whole all of the stores were closed except for grocery stores because of COVID-19.

It fits my laptop perfectly. There is enough padding to adequately protect my equipment without adding too much bulk.  So far, I'm very pleased with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my mac air 2018, hoping to get a snug sleeve for it.  I bought the corrrect size for my computer, as described in the product description.  I was worried about getting a soft cover, but there is enough material thickness at the corners to provide some protection against banging the corners of the laptop. I like the little matching accessory pouch, which holds the charger nicely.","positive":1},{"review":"  Color texture was slightly off from what I was expecting (not majorly different). Feels to be durable and of very good quality and the inside is super soft and plush, the pinnacle of comfort for your laptop or tablet. The tinier case was smaller than I was expecting, however it was a nice bonus for the great price of the case. Overall good quality at an amazing price.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this sleeve for my laptop, the inside of its very soft and my MacBook just slides right in. One downside is that it is way too big for my 13 in MacBook pro. Other than the sleeve being too big, but I really like this product. A side note, there is a slight chemical smell on the product, but it isn't very potent.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a very nice light sleeve for a laptop and the smaller bag was a nice asset.  I had to return mine as reading the inner dimensions I thought that my Acer Laptop would fit.  I probably should have recognized that the corners might cut off those dimensions a bit, but I didn't.  Otherwise nice bag.","positive":1},{"review":"  2018 Macbook Pro 15\". It fits like a glove. I get it, but I didn't find it to be strong and anyway, it faded after a few days, exactly as you'd expect.This is one of those times when I feel like I made an excellent purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this case a lot. The color is exactly like the picture (airy blue). I spilled makeup all over it and I put it in the washing machine, let it air dry, and it looks brand new. I love that the inside is slightly fuzzy and soft :) I will use this case for years to come.","positive":1},{"review":"  UPDATED REVIEW:I had to change my rating from five to two stars. I have been using this case for a bit over a month now. I love how there is a small pouch for the charger as well because my cord can get tangled in my backpack. Overall just a really nice case in general and the price can't be beat.","positive":0},{"review":"  Totally disappointed. This is the second Mosiso case I have bought. Totally disappointed because I could have spent half the price and gotten an amazon basics case, but I wanted them to match. Debating on returning or not, but will probably return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Cuando lo vi me encanto pero cuando lo vi fue como cuando tienes una cota a ciegas jajajajaja est\u00e1 OK funciona pero le falta cosas para que funcione como es La carterista extra PARA EL CARGADOR ES PERFECTA muy pocas la traer por esa eleg\u00ed esta pero el material no es duradero se maltrata mucho y para llegar a un viaje es s\u00faper incomodo en resumida tuve que revenderlo por odio devolver las cosas u comprar otra para poder ir de viaje y que sea inc\u00f3modo eso si la que compre no traer la carterista para el cargador de mi MacBook y eso es un -  algo que me encanto de esta que era un +.","positive":0},{"review":"  So, right off the bat I'll say I wanted to like this case. But it's way too big for my 15 inch laptop. I understand that it isnt \"waterproof\" but my laptop shouldn't look like it does right now. That's why I bought the case, to protect my laptop, and it didnt even do that.","positive":0},{"review":"  The inside lining is extremely soft and I love that it came with a second, smaller pouch, but the 13 is much too big for the Macbook Air 13. If it were to drop, the extreme room would not protect the laptop. Would`ve loved to keep as the color is beautiful, but had to return due to sizing.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop protector DOES NOT fit my 15 MacBook Pro like the description states. Unfair that I have to return it and pay the shipping charge.","positive":0},{"review":"  I just received this product. I ordered the 14-15 inch version. I recommend getting the next size up though for anyone considering this product. (I certainly wish I had.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased the sleeve for 15-15.6\" as recommended according to their size chart but it was WAY WAY WAY too big. The smaller pouch included in the purchase does fit the laptop charge + wires and maybe a few other accessories well. Maybe the 14-15in sleeve would've fit the 15\" macbook pro better but I'm happier with my tomtoc 360 sleeve.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am very disappointed in this laptop sleeve. It says it`s for a 15. It protected my laptop and dried fast but left water marks on the material. I have purchased a different sleeve and will trash this one once the new one delivers and I only had it a few short weeks.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got the size for a 12\" Macbook. It fits it, but, it's loose. This is not the same exact color as the Macbook in rose gold. It also stains easily, but I'm not taking off points for that -- I'm just a slob.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this laptop sleeve and am so happy I purchased it. First, the color is so pretty.*I have not been paid or given a discounted item for this review. I paid full price for this item and this is my honest review.","positive":1},{"review":"  This seems to have enough thickness to protect the computer from most casual accidents and potential scratches. The inside of the sleeve is very soft. Also, I'd like it a bit more if the perimeter of the sleeve had significantly more padding, since this is likely where protection would be needed in the event of a drop. Overall, satisfied with the sleeve and extra case.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to fit my computer into  this carry on for airplane. I had it delivered to where I was going and on the way there I put my computer in a bubble rap envelope. The small pouch that came with it was small but big enough to put the cable and electric adaptor inside. Color was exactly as I expected from the choice and matched my carryon.","positive":1},{"review":"  Time will tell if this continues to be a good purchase, but for the first month this case seems to do what I need it to while on a budget. I am using it for a 14\" Lenovo Flex and it fits quite well. However I'd still get this case for my next laptop if they are still making them. Good quality for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  My sleeve and extra pouch arrived SO QUICKLY (just ordered yesterday) that I could not believe my eyes. They are both very well stitched and reinforced, and the color is beautiful. The smaller pouch easily accommodates the HUGE AC charger that comes with the MacBook (crazy how big that charger is), and I believe I will be able to fit earbuds in there, as well. Highly recommend this set.","positive":1},{"review":"  So my first one of these sleeves wore like iron, but my cat threw up on it and I just didn't want to deal with cleaning it.  I will say this: the cat vomit was unable to penetrate the cover.  However, it's quite protective and very waterproof, so I live with my computer shifting around a bit.  It's very soft inside, so it doesn't do any harm.","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn`t see many reviews for this with photos regarding the Surface 2 Laptop. I got the 13. Overall though i`m definitely going to be using this product. Soft on the inside, thin yet still sturdy, overall good purchase and would recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great laptop sleeve. I have a Dell Inspiron 15 5570 which has a 15. The extra small case for a charger is an added bonus. I haven't tested out how water repellent it is yet, and I don't want to risk it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my Surface Pro 3. On that, it is a little bit bigger than I would like by about half-inch. I think if your tablet or laptop was large enough to fill the whole compartment, you would have some issues trying to do that though. Either way quality product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a new Macbook owner and purchased this product before even getting my Macbook to make sure it would be fully protected. When I received the item, it was as described but ultimately not what I was looking for. I guess I thought the sponge layer was a little thicker but I honestly could barely feel the sponge layer. I travel a lot and I made the decision to return this product on the basis that if my computer was dropped while inside it, I don't think it would offer much protection.","positive":1},{"review":"  Water repellent would be false advertising.:.:. The pictures i posted were after 10 minutes of blow drying on heat and it looks bad and did not absorb much of the drink.","positive":0},{"review":"  This does not fit a 2020 MacBook Pro model A2289. The quality of this item appears to be good, but I'm rating it 2 stars merely because I was misled. When you own a computer this nice, you'd like to have a good fitting sleeve for it to ensure it won't slip and slide while traveling as well as for ease of carrying. In the case of this sleeve, there is significant bunching on the top and bottom when the MacBook is inside.","positive":0},{"review":"  At first, I was super hyped when I bought this since I've been meaning to get a laptop carrier since my old one was too beat up after years of using it. When it arrived, it worked perfectly fine. it's literally in worse condition than my old one.If you want my advice, this product really isn't worth buying unless you're content with having it broken and unusable not even after a year of buying it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this for my daughter's school mac book.  We got it at the end of September and now, a month later, it has broken.  If I could give it negative stars, I would.  Now I have to go buy a new case, though certainly I will be choosing a different brand.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a nice product. I like the lining inside, definitely makes me feel my Mac is safely protected. I just wish I did not get such a light color, or maybe a different fabric from somewhere else. It shows a lot of dirt already from just going in my car and around.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am not one to normally write reviews, but I always look at them before I make a purchase. The reviews for this product seemed very good when I made the purchase. Good thing Amazon has free returns, so I am not too upset about it. I just wish it was what I was anticipating.","positive":0},{"review":"  I put my surface laptop 3 13 inch inside the case and I go to school, then after a couple of hours when I need it, I take it out. I notice it is VERY hot and when I open it, the laptop won't start. This incident happened 5 times already and my surface is a month old. I won't use the case again because I don 't want to laptop to keep burning, which can cause permanent damage.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop case was advertised as fitting the Surface Book 2.. Dent has still not gone away ( it has started to repair itself, but is still visible on the outside of the sleeve). Does not inspire confidence in durability or protectivity.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was pouring rain sideways this morning and my book bag got soaked and the case got wet, I pulled out my macbook and it was damp and case wet inside.  Thankfully the port did not get wet and my macbook is working.  DO NOT GET THIS CASE FOR WATER PROTECTION.  It is also larger than the macbook it moves around in the case.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have had this laptop sleeve (wine-colored) for one year. I had my laptop in this sleeve and, less than a foot off the ground, it fell from my hands and the impact absolutely busted my laptop (the screen was broken and the laptop was unusable).I do not recommend this laptop sleeve if you are looking for a sleeve that would protect your laptop from minor drops and water spillages, as it did not protect mine.This is also a minor pet peeve of mine, but the zippers are not covered by rubber or anything, so anytime you move the laptop sleeve across a tabletop, the zippers drag and make loud noises.","positive":0},{"review":"  Sleeve feels well-made and zippers work as expected. Slightly loose on a 13\" MPB. laptop has space to move inside but not enough to cause concern. Product has held up for the first six months of daily university use with no signs of wear.","positive":1},{"review":"  So, this has been on a few trips. Even though I carry a well-padded computer bag, this cover makes the possibility of damage to my computer much less. I couldn't believe the quality for the cost. As far as cleaning, I wait until I have a few days between travel and clean it with dish soap and let it air dry.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve had this cover for a year and I`ve had to buy a new one recently. This cover is good as a cover but naturally the light color (light blue) got dirty and worn from being in my hands. It`s great, I just learned from my mistake and got a black one this time. On the plus side though the little extra cover for the charging cord was actually VERY useful for keeping it in one place and easy to wrap the cord up to take to classes.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a Macbook air 13' and for the past 4-5 years had a laptop case I liked fine. A few weeks ago, the zipper on that one broke and so I decided it was time to get a new one. The only complaint I have about it is the smell, which I see that other reviewers have noted, but I only really noticed it when I first opened the package, and now it's not that noticeable to me, although I would note that I don't have a particularly strong sense of smell.Overall, I think it was a good buy and hopefully will last me for a while.","positive":1},{"review":"  Only had a few days but I like it for what it is. While I wish it was a snugger fit on the 2014 13inch MacBook Pro, There is about a 1 2 on top and side when it`s pushed into the corner of the sleeve allowing it to slide around when it`s zipped up, but it will work for what it`s intended, being used as a replacement for an oversized laptop bag for travel. The second smaller sleeve is ok, stretchy enough to fit the power brick and the extension cord but is ideal with just the folding plug end on the power brick. Will update my review as it gets used this holiday season of travel.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for a sleeve for my MISTI.  My Sweet Petunia makes a great travel bag but I wanted something more compact to protect it when I threw it in my drawer.  I ordered it originally in dusty blue but it was more like a baby blue and I sent it back and got a black one.  I wish there were more colors available in the size I needed but I am very happy with the product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered the case specifically for MacBooks and I'm so glad I did. The case has a very narrow fit because the MacBook is so thin. I would say it's pretty protective though because it kept my computer safe in my backpack through years of abuse in high school (carrying it around campus to seven different classes daily and not always being the most gentle, to say the least). It also did me well for my freshman year of college and I have no doubt it will do the same.","positive":1},{"review":"  It fits my Lenovo Ideapad perfectly and my charger also fits in the smaller sleeve with no issues. The inside is a soft, velvety texture and the zippers are of good quality. My laptop was in my backpack and the sleeve got damp but it didn't soak through.I would have liked the material on the outside of the sleeve to be a little thicker but the important part is it provides basic protection for my laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this set as I was entering Grad school and wanted to ensure I took good care of my Mac. THIS IS SO Fantastic. Which I'm sure can be resolved if I hand washed it. Overall, makes me wanna buy for my friends who are living their lives on the Wildside by just putting their laptops anywhere.","positive":1},{"review":"  Roomy. MacBook Air Retina 2018 model fits easily.Durability: the material is already pilling and has lots of nicks in it. Considering the low price, I don't mind.","positive":1},{"review":"  You read the title. For a twelve to fifteen dollar worth cover, it's ok. Just buy a better one and spend a little more to protect your previous cargo. Spending twenty more on your cover will be the difference between buying a new macbook or simply cleaning the dust off your durable, dependable cover.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought for my daughter to use for her school laptop.  This color gets dirty so quick. Did not clean very well at all and she's already decided it looks bad enough not to continue using it.  It is a nice thickness and has good protection while laptop is in her backpack, but next time will go for a darker color as it does not clean easily.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my 12\" MacBook based on the review and product description. But this is cheap quality product even not proper dimension and not at all looks as in the picture. I return it right away. Never recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was so excited to get this sleeve within 24hrs that I didn`t read the reviews mentioning water stains. I love the color, it`s exactly as pictured, however, within seconds I managed to set my case in some left over kid residue on my counter so I scrub it off, let it dry while I go to an orchestra concert, and come back to a giant water stain. Assuming this may have been from something in the sponge I scrub it with laundry detergent and rinse it out in the sink. But because it`s not water proof and I need it tomorrow, I stick it in the dryer for 25 minutes, where not only has the water stain moved, but now the zippers have left marks all over the sides of the sleeve.","positive":0},{"review":"  VERY disappointed on sizing of this. Although it states 13.3\" it is considerably oversized for the MacBook Air 2020. Quilty and function are simply okay but expected a much better fit than what was advertised.","positive":0},{"review":"  This (Mosiso) is much less expensive than the Incase brand neoprene sleeve.  Unfortunately, the Incase 13 inch does not fit a 13 inch Macbook air - it is too large.  Laptops can be easily 'bumped' and damaged.  You need some protection - this provides none, except possibly for dampness.","positive":0},{"review":"  I should give it a 2 star, but given it's price I guess it's value for the money. The zipper hasn't broken yet (1 month in), but its not as protective as I'd like...","positive":0},{"review":"  The case is nice but it is larger than my MacBook Air 13.3. Please contact me to send me one that fits better. Thank you.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this case for it's simplicity and cushion. I must say I love it. I even checked the measurements and the second one should've fit. Just be careful.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this product for my new MacBook. My other MacBook had a thick, cushioned cover which I find protects my MacBook. The zippper works really well though. Would I buy this again for another computer, probably not.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is my go-to sleeve for my 13\" MacBook Pro and its charger. The inside is nice and soft, and it protects against scratches and dirt dust. They have a small silicon-like logo in the bottom right on one side, which is black on mine so it blends in with the rest of the sleeve.Overall, good product, hasn't failed me yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my daughter's Dell Inspiron 13 laptop.  It fit.  I'm hoping it holds up (a snug fit can be tough on seams) and that the light color either doesn't show dirt too quickly or will clean up well.  Only time will tell.","positive":1},{"review":"  The bag was constructed well with solid stitching, straight lines (except bottom of the bag),  and smooth-gliding zippers. The only [minor] issue that I have with this product is the slight curvature on the bottom of the larger case. Perhaps it will stretch out some with time and use, but at least it still fits so I can't really complain. Would definitely recommend this case to others, though.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop sleeve and smaller sleeve arrived undamaged and of the quality I expected. The inside is like fleece (not exactly, in my opinion, but really close). I charged mine overnight in the case, and when I woke up in the morning and unplugged my laptop, the laptop and sleeve were hot. My guess is that the sleeve doesn't allow proper ventilation for the laptop's fan.","positive":1},{"review":"  I haven't tested for water resistance, but it works great as a case. It keeps my laptop dust free while in my bag, and I like the small case for my charger. Only problem is that mine is a bit big, but I could have ordered a small size, so that on me. I have a 15\" mid 2015 MacBook pro and I order the 15 16\" case.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for grad school and it lasted me the 2.5 years it took me to get my degree. I loved that the charger got a matching case. This case also has saved my computer a couple of time from being completely shattered.","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn`t rate on the water resistance, durability, and traveling since I just opened the package. It is lighter in person but still a pretty navy blue. I am using the laptop case for my work computer so it is nice and safe and the charging case for my personal computer charger. I don`t think it will be big enough for the extension to my cord which I usually bring with me but looks like it will fit the basic charger.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great attractive, quality sleeve with handy extra case to hold charger cables. I ordered the case in Red Rose. I have a laptop bag but like having the sleeve for extra protection or when I just don`t need want to tote a heavier bag. With the sleeve I can also slip my laptop into my larger tote handbags without worrying about scratches.","positive":1},{"review":"  Really happy with both of these little laptop sleeves. I ordered the set for my work laptop. I liked the fact that it came with a smaller sleeve for things like the laptop charger, a flash drive, or a computer mouse. The only thing I wish was a little different was that there was some type of way to attach the bigger sleeve to the smaller sleeve so you don't have to worry about 2 separate sleeves separating from each other.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I first saw this laptop sleeve AND charger sleeve set in my favorite shade of peony pink, I was very exited. Both fit, however not as snuggly as I would like. I`ve had this set for about a month and nothing has happened to my laptop thus far. I`ll update as time progresses.","positive":1},{"review":"  The seller was ok but the case for the MacBook Pro smells very strong of chemicals. As suggested by Mosiso I washed the case with a neutral detergent and let it air out for a week. When you contact the company all they will suggest is washing the case. I will update this review if things change.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is great. The inside is soft..this is not it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Measured my computer. It measured at 11. After trying it on my computer I found that the case is to small and I can't zipper it with the computer inside. Disappointed in myself for embroidering it before making sure it fit.","positive":0},{"review":"  very unsatisfied. I received this product in the mail today ...","positive":0},{"review":"  It's cover sheet that's water protective but it's kinda big for the MAC BOOK PRO size. Personally I want one fit exactly right so there is no awkward space around to make it more secure. The small cable cord, was disappointing because I aiming for it help with it's organization but it didn't it was just a piece of cover. I regret my choice i should have gotten the organized ones that help the cord stay in place.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a high quality laptop sleeve. It looks professional and appears to be well made. As stated, the interior dimensions should be a perfect fit for my MSI GE62, but I could barely get it to go into the sleeve and zipping it up was almost impossible - it looked as though the corners of my laptop would rip through the sleeve in a short time. Had to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I received the product, I immediately found the product damaged. The opposite side of the zipper that maintains the square shape, i. There is still a chance for the seller. I will wait and see the return processing and refund procedure.","positive":0},{"review":"  Super cute laptop case, as I ordered the 13-13.3 in case for my MacBook Pro.The case is super cute and affordable for the price, as I also like that they provide you with a smaller pouch for your charger.  However I do experience problems with the ease of closing the case, and am not sure if others experience the same as well.","positive":0},{"review":"  Item looked cheaper than I expected.  The material seems to attract dirt, so I handwashed it a couple of weeks after I purchased it.  Very poor quality.  I would not recommend this product--I am very disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is exactly what i need. It fits my late 2014 15\" MacBook Pro like a glove but the only issue is that it doesn't have an interior neoprene flat to go over the laptop so the zippers (if depressed) will hit and scratch the computer casing. Bummed cus finding these exact inter dimensions is really hard and i love the little matching neoprene pouch it comes with.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a well made bag for my Macbook Air that helps pad my laptop when I'm transporting it to and from school each day. It does seem waterproof (haven't tested it yet. The pink is not as dark as in the picture and the zipper part is darker than the rest of the bag which makes it look a little odd. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this case. It is cute, cheap, and feminine. The extra pouch for chargers is a perfect size. Overall, this product is really good for the price and for college students who want quick, cheap protection.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this case for about a month and I love it. My laptop fits in the case and the case really protects the laptop. I have a 13in laptop and bought the case for the 13in and there is plenty of room so much so that I put my charger in the case. I personally like that but if you want the case to be snug on the laptop, then you might want to look another case.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a HP Spectre x360 13.3 notebook. It fits my power brick and cords perfectly so I know that`s protected in the bottom of my bag too. Would definitely buy again.","positive":1},{"review":"  Perfect. Fits a Macbook charger in the little bag perfectly, but any other charger definitely doesn't zip closed all the way -- but hey, it doesn't say it does so that's really just a side notationI spilled water on my bag while on a roadtrip, and it seeped through the bag AND this case...","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a Dell Latitude 7480. I bought a 15\", black sleeve bag, which is a little larger than I needed. I have a smaller backpack for ergonomic reasons and the sleeve's slim profile still fits nicely into the backpack without compromising on its purpose of protecting my laptop. I was very happy with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently dropped my MacBook inside of my backpack and it got a small ding on the corner. I was happy that the small dent was the only damage. The color is also pretty and it closely matches my rose gold MacBook.I have not tested it with a drop and hope that it never happens, but with the padding and spillproof case I feel confident that my precious work laptop is protected.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop sleeve is perfect for my needs. I ordered the 13 inch one for the newest MacBook Air model, and in my opinion it fits well. I bought this sleeve a year ago for my son's MacBook Air. I just bought the second one for my own MacBook Pro.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is exactly what I could have hoped for and more: the color is perfect, and the inside is very soft. The case is thick for protection without being bulky. I didn`t have to work with customer service at all, but they did send an email to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase. Overall: great experience, great price, great case.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love how this laptop sleeve comes with a smaller sleeve for chargers etc. Before I used to shove my charger into my laptop sleeve and it would just look bulky. I also love the texture, it is very soft to the touch. I don't know about its water resistance and I don't plan to test it out but it is a very nice sleeve overall.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was pretty disappointed with this product because the material is very thin and I don't feel that my laptop is protected. It doesn't have handles so you can't easily pick it up. it's so thin it cannot fit anything inside, ESPECIALLY not a charger. Don't waste your money.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was a nice case for the price. Unfortunately though it's internal dimensions claimed it was big enough for my Dell 13.3 inch laptop it was too tight & couldn't zip shut. Also the bonus case was too small for my power adapter.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received the product yesterday and planning to return it today (at kohls) as the product did not meet my needs.  The dimension mentioned in the specifications is incorrect in the four corners as the corners are bent for which reason the product at the corners are short by few cms (around 1 2 inch). Because of the corner bents, my laptop did not fit into the bag.  Quality wise this is a good product and worth buying it if it fits your needs.","positive":0},{"review":"  I spilled some water on the case, thank goodness my laptop was not in the case as i was using my laptop. the water left a huge stain on the case. Do not buy, get your moneys worth on a good case. I wish I would`ve purchased their case for my laptop instead of the sleeve.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had received this guy about 5 days ago. It`s very soft inside and the color is nice. I wonder if this has happened to anyone else. I might just keep it to not waste things and if it gets worse I will send it back by it`s  return date of May 26.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a nice case, I got the green case. It's fine with water but it stains very easily. I wouldn't recommend it. I would've given it a 1 star but it's convenient and the color is nice.","positive":0},{"review":"  This sleeve is OK and probably good value for the money. However I don`t feel it`s a good option for the new 2018 MacBook Air, as the laptop has lots of wiggle room inside.The accessory pouch is very handy. Really like that.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this case for my MacBook Air A2179. The case does not fit well. Too baggy fitting. I`m disappointed with it for sure.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I opened the box, it wasn't even wrapped in plastic.  It had a large stain as if something had been spilled on it.  My laptop fit great and was able to throw it in my large purse for air travel - which is exactly what I wanted it for.  Not a bad purchase - if they send you a new one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this case from my brand new MacBook Pro 13' and I love the color, its perfect. But it is very big for my computer. Although not very tight and secure, the material is great and is waterproof as advertised. the charger case is great, fits everything nicely.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered the peacock green, and the color was completely accurate, I was very happy with it. It fit my Mac perfectly and I really like the smaller case that comes with it. I did spill a drop of something on it and it did not seep through to the inside. All in all I am happy with this product and the product is affordable.","positive":1},{"review":"  i've had my laptop for many years, but kept putting off getting a laptop case because 'it's too expensive'. However, every time it rained or I carried water, I feared for my laptop and would check to make sure it was okay. I love the charger case(small, but definitely holds my macbook charger) and the slimness of the laptop case itself. Seems durable and I'm very happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop sleeve is soft and fit my laptop perfectly (15inch Dell Inspiron). The case feels durable, alright quality   materials, and is reliable to hold my laptop.This case is perfect for a weekend getaway if you want to make sure your computer stays safe. However, if you're looking for an every day case, I would suggest something more sturdy or a case with a strap to hold it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The material feels really nice and I love the neutral color. The fabric can expand and the stitching is still intact without ever looking like it'll rip. I would've liked the case to be a good fit for my laptop and not having to worry about it easily slipping out of my hand or moving around so much in the case. I would've liked for the seller to have an option of picking the correct size, instead of in-between sizes, for a laptop for future buyers.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this bag for additional travel protection for my MacBook.  I bought it in a larger size so that it would fit over my original Mosiso folio cover with some additional foam sheets that I wanted to include.  To date, both of my Mosiso products have more than met my expectations.  I look forward to years of service.","positive":1},{"review":"  I liked the color, finish and lush interior. To my dismay I found that the 15-15. It fits my 15in MacBook Pro perfectly. The sleeve is beautiful and since it fits, it's a 5.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love these. The separate pouch for chargers avoids you a bulky laptop case. The color is super cute and and the material is super soft. Did I say I love these.","positive":1},{"review":"  Received this case today & it fits the Macbook Air (A2179) with a slim case on it. I like the extra little pouch it comes with, it fits the charger nicely & protects it inside my bag. & is very soft & plush inside. Zipper seems sturdy as well, but I have just received this today and have not used it yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very pretty, feels sturdy. I ordered Serenity Blue, but it definitely looks more like Airy Blue, so since the color isn`t correctly portrayed in the photo, I knocked off a star. which is a bummer. The other photos look pretty true to color.","positive":1},{"review":"  So the reviews that said this thing smelled gnarly were spot on. It does. The colors match nicely and the macbook fits in the softshell just fine with the hardshell on. I like that it also comes with a smaller bag for the charger.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just got a new Mac airbookAnd wanted a decent case for itConsidering the price, should be expectedBut I didn`t expect for the material to go bad within a a dayI would recommend another itemI`ll post pics later.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I found this item I was so excited. It seemed like a good deal. The zipper broke for me and it could break for you. Don't waste your money, buy something the will work for the long run.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`ve purchased different colors for different Macs before and they were perfect but this one was disappointing, unfortunately. It`s a lot more peachy than tan khaki and it`s too big for a MacBook Air (which was in the name and description) so I`m a bit disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's a lot baggier than I expected.  I ordered the 13-13.  The extra bag for the plug or mouse is nice.  Hard to beat the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  This case is beautiful however it is too loose for my comfort level. It`s almost as if you cannot hold onto it properly because the 2019 MacBook Air 13 is just flopping around in there.","positive":0},{"review":"  This gets the job of providing some padding for your machine when you take it with you. It's an ugly color and I wish I could have bought a darker one. The extra cover for the power cord is a nice touch, altho it is too small if I take the longer plug extention with me, and I always do. The power cord is, otherwise, too short for many spots.","positive":0},{"review":"  The color was not at all like pictured in the listing, nor like photos in the reviews.  The color of the sides is very different from the color of the body of the sleeve.  Must have been a change in quality since those pictures were taken.  I will be returning unfortunately.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love the material - protective outer cover and super soft interior - but it doesn't match the dimensions given in the description, and is too large for a MacBook Pro. My laptop slides around inside it, which makes me feel it's less secure.The extra pouch is handy for accessories, though.","positive":0},{"review":"  I let these air out for two days but could not get rid of the smell.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is AMAZING however,..The pic doesn`t do this item any justice. As well, the description is extremely accurate.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought in 2017 for my MacBook air and still in good condition. Loved it . Don't expect water resistance though. But still one of the best you can get at least for travelling.","positive":1},{"review":"  With my Macbook Pro, was looking for a secure sleeve to store and carry around.  This fit the bill.  Either your charger including cable or your mouse but not both.  This also is based on the same material.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was pleasantly surprised with this sleeve. It also has a second pocket for a mouse. The zipper seems very sturdy as well. Love it so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  Awesome product, a steal for the price. I was a little nervous about purchasing the pink because of some reviews stating the color is different in person.3 size to air on side of caution, because I will be putting a hard case on it, and didn`t want that to make it not fit. Overall a great purchase, it`s lovely, I would definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I work remote and carry my laptop everywhere still needed a cover even when slipping into a bag.  This is perfect not too bulky at all and fits in most bags even with computer soft lining.  Great for travel if your laptop fits in carry on luggage for triple protection and having to take out of your bag in security this way the computer is not uncovered.  Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far the case is good. I live in a state where it rains a lot and decided to Cary my lab top to class since it`s waterproof it actually worked.Verdicts still out on this one but so far it gets 4 stars. I`ll be back to give an update on how well it holds up and keeps my computer safe.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this case for my MacBook Pro 13-inch and the computer fits and all but it is not a snug fit as I would like. There is about 1 inch of space left at the top which isn't a bag thing but I would've preferred a bit more snug fit. If I were to put the cable adapter it looks too bulky so I just keep that to the side. I would totally recommend this product for anyone looking for a laptop case.","positive":1},{"review":"  My husband bought this first and I really like the material so I got one for myself. Our Dell XPS 15 9370s fits right in and there's still some room to stash some files folders - mind you these are slim laptops. We haven't really tested if they're water repellent but we bought these more for storage purposes to keep the dust out and we hope we won't spill anything on them or that if we do, it is indeed water repellent.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased to protect my new 12\" MacBook.  It fits perfectly.  Just to protect it from day to day scratches during commutes and travel.  If you want or expect full protection, buy a Pelican case or a Panasonic tough book.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my fault - I think I should have gotten the 13 inch not the 13.3 inch sleeve.  I would say at the most the charger - I have a wireless mouse and a dongle that I used and that definitely is not going to fit into the pouch.  I'll keep looking and will be passing this sleeve onto someone that may be able to use it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The best part of this product is the fabric quality. The color is not as pictured, I ordered light pink that looks ballet pink in the photos, but a salmon cover showed up. The design of this case is the flaw. When I put my MAC and accessories  into the case, it's bulky and odd to carry without handles.","positive":0},{"review":"  I should`ve read the 1 star reviews. This case is too big. They need to measure their items correctly. I`m sending this back because I want a sleeve that fits, not where my laptop is sliding around.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s very flimsy and that`s enough of a problem to be unusable.  And it doesn`t fit like a sleeve the models advertised.  Didn`t matter which size I tested with it bubbles out in places and will only collect dust until I toss it.","positive":0},{"review":"  My MacBook is a size 13.3 so I got the case that said 13-13.  I love the color as well. I got the nice pastel pink color but beware, it gets dirty quickly.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product was huge in my 13 MacBook Air and stained very easily. I purchased the light blue and tried washing it but the stain wouldn`t come out. I don`t really use the second pouch for the charger.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was pretty excited about this and I thought it looked pretty good when it arrived, but then I noticed that one side of the zipper area was dirty. Not too much, tbh, but too much for me to believe the product was new, and just kind of gross. Returning it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this case because it was listed as 13-13.3\" case that would fit my 13. There is at least 1\" of space between side and top of laptop and it just slides all over the place rather than fitting closely as I expected it would. It seems decently constructed but I can't speak to the durability because it's going to be returned.","positive":0},{"review":"  I own a 15 IN. MacBook Pro, while on the smaller end of the size range for this case there is way too much room. The small charger sleeve is perfect for a MacBook charger. I love it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Reason it got two stars is because when I nearly dropped my macbook and trapped it between my leg and dresser it cracked the shell but it did protect my laptop.  However with it cracked I don`t think I can trust it a second time.","positive":0},{"review":"  Terrible quality. The sleeve came with the zipper damaged and impossible to open. I filed for a refund immediately. Thank goodness Amazon is so good with returns and I wasn't out any money.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this sleeve for a 13.3\" Yoga model 730 which must be close in size to a Mac book or Surface Pro.  I can't say if it is truly water resistant since I haven't spilled anything on it and don't plan to.  However it is padded nicely and hopefully serve the purpose I purchased it for.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my wife for her new MacBook Air.  She wanted a way to carry her laptop into client meetings without having to lug around a whole bag.  Apart from the heavy rubber synthetic smell when you first release it, the sleeve has had my wife grinning since she unwrapped it.  Can't vouch for durability yet, but we are happy customers so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had been using this laptop protector for my laptop for some time now and it's definitely reassuring. The quality is also really good. And so glad that I found this. Low cost, worth the price, great quality and fast shipping.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was a bit skeptical about its size when the sleeve-set arrived. The main laptop sleeve appeared a bit smaller than expected but as pictured, it is a perfect fit for the macbook pro with no room for inside movement (which sometimes results in zipper scratches  or panel abrasions). Most of all, the set comes with two smaller sleeves for portable storage and organization of small accessories such as adapters, hubs, and cable charger. I would highly recommend this product for its design and overall price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This an extremely well-made sleeve bought for my MacBook Air 13\". The inside is made out of an extremely soft material to keep your iPad, laptop, or notebook computer safe from bumps and scratches. Given the price and the exceptional customer service, I'm a happy owner. Mosiso impresses me as a company owned by folks who want their customers to be pleased and to pass the good word on.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought one for my work laptop and one for my personal laptop. Very nice cases, good quality fabrics zippers construction, perfect for both laptops of different sizes (I measured to ensure I got the correct sizes). Fuzzy soft interior to prevent scratching.Each large case comes with a smaller case which I use for accessories.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a 2017 13inch MacBook Pro and this has a little extra room in it. I think it could probably fit a 15 inch. I like it a lot. I think it will be great for travel.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've ordered two of these and have returned both for the color. The first was supposed to be a dark blue but was clearly more of a baby blue. Going to keep it simple and go for black -- third time's a charm, right.Other than that, this is a fine sleeve for the price and offers a good layer of extra protection when carrying my 2015 13\" MacBook Pro inside a laptop bag or backpack.","positive":1},{"review":"  There is a lot of empty space, I should have measured.. Laptop case could be snugger, and cord pouch could be bigger. Can't speak for water resistance, haven't spilled on it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall I love this product.The material is a little thinner than I imagined it would be, however, it is water proof and would protect it in a minor drop. The mini pouch Is obviously perfect for the charger however when you put the pouch in the sleeve it develops an awkwardly large bulge so I tend to just throw it in my purse. love the product and would recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for MBP 13\" 2018 laptop. I have attached the following case to it: https:  www.5-2\" on the top. But it looks good, I got the maroon color.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like everything about this sleeve except the size. I have the new MacBook Air a 13 inch and this sleeve seems like it could easily fit even a 15 inch laptop. Pretty disappointed because I'm in love with the color and feel of it. I guess it would work for someone who doesn't mind their computer sliding around in the sleeve, but I am looking for a more snug fit.","positive":0},{"review":"  It doesn't seem to have much protection if the device is dropped. However I just purchased to protect my laptop in my book bag (from scratches) so it should do the job. The smaller bag for the cord was almost too small. In the future inwould suggest the manufacturer make it a little bigger.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I got the sleeve, overall it looked good the smaller bag is a slightly different shade of pink compared to the laptop sleeve. I then notice some brown smudges on the front of the sleeve but a little bit of water and a paper towel fixed it. I don't want to give a bad review, the product seems great overall. I just wanted to share my experience.","positive":0},{"review":"  ..  Sending it back.Appreciated the simplicity of the design, and the padding is substantial, but the smell makes it a no-go.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great price. Minimal look which is what I wanted. Looks a little cheap and the light pink color seems it will dirty quick. But again for the price I was definitely happy with my purchase and I'm currently using it.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you are looking for a sleeve that is more for storing it away on your desk then this is perfect for you. The texture and fabric very cheap. It's a lot larger than it needed it to be and didn't have any cushion for the laptop. Just spend the extra money on a better one.","positive":0},{"review":"  The quality of the case is great and it seems like it`ll be durable. The material inside is very soft and there`s enough room in the case to include my 2020 MacBook Pro 13in and 2019 11in IPad Pro with a case. I gave it 3 stars because the pouch that comes with the case is very small, I can barely fit my mouse and MacBook charger in there and that`s the entire reason I bought this case is to have something to hold my accessories in. So I was very disappointed that I am unable to hold all my cords and computer accessories.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this bag for my 12 dell which is surprisingly heavy for a little guy. This sleeve is so stretchy that the contents all Buick out in the bottom and I have to grip the bag at the top. I just think it would be easier with a handle.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a nice case, but I ordered a 13 and this is 15. I`m very disappointed in the size, but the overall quality is nice. I would return it but it`s too much of a hassle at this point with traveling for the summer.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a laptop sleeve, the zipper is strong, and it holds my laptop. Yay. Recommend it. Just don't get the baby pink one.","positive":1},{"review":"  i got this case for my macbook air mainly to prevent scratches while its in my backpack. it got a little wiggle space which would be good if you have a snap-on case. afterwards, only the top layer was just slightly damp, but the inside was completely dry. im actually very impressed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently purchased the Macbook Pro and needed a case that could protect my Macbook from spills. So far, I have no complaints. As far as the smaller case, I am able to fit several different cords in it at one time without issue. This is a strong recommendation for anyone looking to add some color to their life.","positive":1},{"review":"  I measured my laptop to make sure the fit would be snug. I have a Microsoft surface laptop 3 and I believe the product suggests getting the '13. cant comment much on anything else because I just got it. Also might be helpful to mention I dont have a case on my laptop yet but Im sure it will fit just as well once I do.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, I`d say this is a pretty good laptop case for the price but has its minor flaws. Minor flaws would be the protection of the case. That is the only downfall. Other than that, it is pretty water resistant and good for traveling.","positive":1},{"review":"  After my trusty old incase Macbook sleeve wore out, I went to look for another and noticed Incase inflated their prices beyond belief, so I took a chance on this product. This item was a real money saver for me. The bare metal zipper tabs may be a little noiser than the rubber coated metal tabs and if this bothers you it can easily be remedied with products like plasti-dip. This will me my new go-to product for laptop cases.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have an acer spin 5. This case fit very well, the additional bonus of the small pouch was great since I can put the charger in there without worrying it will damage my laptop. The fit was not the issue, there was actually 2 inches away from the zipper so I didn't have to force anything.It does smell a bit weird when you first get it, but the smell goes away.","positive":1},{"review":"  **Purchased for my daughter so review is from my daughter **it's very roomy I totally fit my laptop, chargers, plus my entire Nintendo switch and it's chargers so very scrumptious.","positive":1},{"review":"  Finally. This is the 3rd case I have purchased for my surface 2 laptop because sizing is weird on Amazon. I got the wine color and it's a nice dark magenta. I recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to store my Macbook Air. The insides are very soft and dust resistant thereby helping to prevent scratches on your machine. It has padding which will help cushion small drops, though I haven't tested this. Overall, it is a perfect laptop sleeve for 14inch laptops.","positive":1},{"review":"  my product came in wet INSIDE THE PACKAGE.. the item seems okay otherwise, but this is just really gross.edit: made stars higher after i got replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  One zipper broke after 6 weeks of light use, using it only ~4 times per week. Very disappointed. I would urge you to look elsewhere for a laptop case. Loved the color (navy blue), but it is useless now.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got the black one. Good color and fabric. Good product to have with a case on the actual computer too, like i do. If looking to only have a sleeve and no case on the computer, I would not recommend this product as it doesn`t provide much drop protection .","positive":0},{"review":"  While the product listing advertises that it fits the 2019 MacBook Air 13, the isn't exactly as snug as you might think. The laptop definitely fits in the bag, BUT there is a quite a bit of excess room (I'm considering trying the 12in to see if it'll be a better fit). I give it two stars because while it's not terrible, it's definitely not great..","positive":0},{"review":"  This serves the purpose and the additional small case for the power supply is handy. The padding is not as good as the memory foam case I had for my previous MacBook Air. This case is a pretty loose fit for my MacBook 12\". It was shipped folded in half and there is still a visible crease almost 3 months later.","positive":0},{"review":"  There was nearly an inch of extra room even though I ordered the correct size for my 13\" MBP.In addition, the foam already had a dent in it from the little pouch being packed inside the main large sleeve - I would have kept it if it had fit as it is a slim fit sleeve that does not add bulk - but my laptop was not flush at all inside. For anyone looking for a sleeve that will protect against bumps and knocks - this is NOT it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Comparing it to my laptop case which was advertised as the same color.It`s much much lighter in color in person. Will probably get a different color because of that.","positive":0},{"review":"  I already have this cover for my  12\" macbook and the fit was perfect. I ordered a second one, also for the same Macbook but it is too big..that green wasn't a great idea but the cover really is great otherwise.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Feels like I could fit 3 of my laptops in it, makes me feel nervous about protection with it just sliding around.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop sleeve has held up for several months of use. I wish it was slightly less flexible and more sturdy than it is. It's not ideal, so knocked it down a star for that annoyance. Other than that, it's a decent buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Laptop Sleeve, Mosiso Water-resistant Neoprene Case Bag Cover for 12.9 iPad Pro   13.  The tiny neoprene pouch is perfect for carrying the charging cube and cord.I'm very happy with this sleeve and wholeheartedly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this quite frequently wether it is on a plane trip, or to my local coffee shop. it is a simple easy design that you can customize to your liking with color and size. The durability is good, before I got this I actually chipped my laptop so this has protected it ever since. I haven't had experience with water damage, however when your bag is being tossed around in an airport it protects your technology a lot.","positive":1},{"review":"  I only gave easy to clean 3 stars because I purchased the light blue color. That is my own fault. I also love that the larger bag for the actual computer is roomy enough to hold the littler bag. Makes it a lot easier to keep everything organized and together.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my 13\" Macbook Air (older version) because my old case's zipper broke. This case comes with a smaller pouch -- I'm assuming for a mouse or external hard drive-- I gave this away because I didn't need it, but I could see the use for it. It's thick enough and lightly padded for protection, just like my old one. And the zipper works -- score.","positive":1},{"review":"  This case is great for my macbook pro 13.. Not too much space left when putting the laptop inside the case. Would deff recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  The case is lightweight and very cute but IS NOT WATERPROOF. I left this in my bag and it rained, water seeped through and nearly ruined my laptop :( I would recommend it if you have a waterproof backpack or if you don't need it to keep your devices safe from water damage. It is durable enough to be washed several times so I will give it that.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you have anything as small and flat as a Mac book this will do the trick. It's very cushioned and fits my mouse, laptop, charger and external hard drive with no fuss and there is still space left in side.It's plush and nicely insulation and a great size.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been using this case for over a year and you would never be able to tell. I use these cases every time I travel and they have not torn or gotten stained at all - they look practically brand new. Very convenient and fit my MacBook and Charger perfectly. I highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my new 2017 12.3\" surface pro, hoping it would fit the device and the rugged case (a Kensington black belt) I put it in - and it does. The inside is a soft fur-like lining. Great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This fit my little Asus laptop better than any other case I have tried, so the measurements were true to size. The smaller pouch was the right size for passports while traveling, and really came out to be more useful than I anticipated. Seems like it will be reasonably water resistant since it's neoprene. Happy with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Its cute and I love the light blue color but my 13 in macbook doesn't fit snugly inside. it's still too big. The little accessory pouch is too small and doesn't hold a charger, plus a couple of cables. pretty much only the charging cable will fit inside.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this along with one of their snap on hard cases. Honestly it's a struggle to get my laptop in.That said, it's thick sturdy material, it's made well, and it's true to color. Plus, the mini pouch was a cute bonus.","positive":0},{"review":"  At first I really liked this laptop sleeve-- it seemed well made and the color was super cute. However, within a month of regular use (college student), the zipper stopped working entirely, and began to rip off the sides where it was attached. Would not recommend this at all, not worth the money. Also, although this is not the sellers fault beware that light colors get dirty super quickly.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product isn`t very durable. The inside is nice and smooth, but it doesn`t have enough padding to truly protect your computer. It`s not waterproof or water resistant, and it also doesn`t last very long. The case quickly became dirty.","positive":0},{"review":"  Does not fit the MacBook pro 13.. you don't want to put your 2k MacBook in this cheap, ill fitted case Will not recommend anyone. It is a waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very cheap material. Case isn`t specifically made for a MacBook Air. I expected it to have a snug fit. This case fits my 10 year old Mac book pro much better.","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased the 13-13.5 size for my 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro. The case seems durable and good quality, the inside is very soft, but it is far too large and roomy for my laptop. Although it seems like it`ll probably be protected, my laptop slides around in it and the extra room makes it bulky and hard to carry.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is not the size of Macbook air 13.3. Bigger than MacBook so it is loose in it. Doesn`t fit tightly.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is 0% water repellent. I spilled a small splash of coffee on it and it immediately soaked through. Very disappointing. Water repellent needs to be completely taken out of the name.","positive":0},{"review":"  I think the case feels like really good quality but the photo given of this color airy blue is way off. It`s way lighter in person. It`s not ugly just not what I wanted.","positive":0},{"review":"  ThisWas exactly what I wanted for air travel.  I wanted something that I could put all of my plane electronics - tablet, phone, earbuds, cables - so I could pull one thing out of my carry on when I get on the plane and also I wouldn`t have to worry about leaving something behind. It`s been just what`d I`d hope for - roomy enough for everything.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this sleeve. I have the clear case on my laptop from this same brand , and it fits in here still. I have the MacBook Air 2020 , and it fits good. I bought this cause of the color and it did not disappoint.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this case.  First of all, it's a super pretty rose color which is actually even better than the pictures make it look.  I haven't yet found a use for the mini bag that comes along with it.  If you have an external hard drive though, it would be good for that.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything was as expected with this case. The inside is really soft and the case itself is thick and squishy. I'd recommend this case, especially for the price. Cannot comment on the water proof part though.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this awesome genuine leather messenger bag that worked as a very stylish and official carrying case for my computer from my roommate this year for Christmas. One problem though, it didn't have much cushioning to protect my $1500 laptop from being crushed or dropped within the bag.This sleeve did the perfect trick as it has great foam cushioning,  super soft anti-static lining and came in my all-time favorite color. And as an added bonus, the extra accessories sleeve fit perfectly for the pocket in my leather bag to protect my peripheral devices too.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is exactly as expected. I probably shouldn't have gotten such a light color because it shows dirt. It is roomy. Perfect for what I needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a college student with a 13.3\" Mac, and so having a case was totally necessary because I do NOT want to have to buy a new one. I am even currently using it to write this review, lol. Now that I know the case works, I'll probs have to look into getting one in another color.","positive":1},{"review":"  GREAT sleeve for any laptop. It`s made from a neoprene type material with a very soft brushed faux fur inside. I can`t comment to how water resistant this but judging by the outer material I wouldn`t be surprised if it were adequately water repellent. Overall, this is a great protective sleeve for a nice price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros: Fits Dell XPS 15 7590 laptop (see Cons). Simple design without pockets or in your face branding. By design, the minimal padding is great by not adding bulk allowing you to slip it into another carrying case but also does not provide a great amount of protection, especially in the corners. Time will tell if it holds up but as of now I would recommend if someone wanted a minimalist sleeve.","positive":1},{"review":"  Even though it came with a small pouch I do wish it had an additional pocket. If you are like me you have a lot of cords and other things to carry with your tablet laptop. I love the small pouch to keep my external charger and cord for my phone. The charger for the Surface was a little to bulky for it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Way too big for my MacBook Pro 16. I wanted something to hold it snug like all of my other laptop sleeves have done in the past. Plus there is a lot of space height wise too, so the computer slides all around. I will be looking for one with a snugger first.","positive":0},{"review":"  Big and bulky. Not sleek at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  A had a cover for my old larger laptop that had enough cushion to protect an egg. This is a decorative cover. It will protect your laptop from scratches but hand with extra care.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I first purchased this item, I was excited to use it because it looked high quality. However, sitting in my backpack while walking to class during one rain, the case became completely soaked through and now has ugly yellow water stains that I can't get rid of.On top of this, both of the zipper tabs have fallen off somehow even though the slider is still completely in tact.","positive":0},{"review":"  The toxic chemical smell is powerful enough to fill an entire apartment. It is so strong that the back of my throat feels irritated.  Also, it is about 1 4 inch too big for the new MacBook Air 13 inch (2017 model). The other name brand fits snuggly but this one failed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought the 13-13.3 case for my wife`s MacBook Air 13. The case looks great but the fit is terrible. It`s really baggy as if it`s for a 15-17 inch computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought the 13-13 inch sleeve for my 2017 MacBook Pro 13\" but it's way too big, there's plenty of place on the side and on the top. It does fit my 2011 MacBook Air 13.3\" perfectly. I'd recommend it for the old MacBook but not the new one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the size 13.3in because that`s the size of my MacBook Pro but this case is too big for it.  There is roughly 2in of extra space on top and roughly 1.5in on the side.","positive":0},{"review":"  Save your money.  I liked the idea of being able to carry charger in nice bag separate so wouldn`t scratch computer.  I have really small charger and cord and I could barely get cord.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unutterably cheesy. The fabric looks grubby quickly, and snags easily. Plastic zipper does not inspire confidence. There are far better sleeves out there.","positive":0},{"review":"  Loved that this came with a case for my charger as well. I may have gotten a bit too small, but it stretched and worked for about a year and a half. Kept my computer safe. The inside has a really cushioned and very soft micro-furry fabric (if that's even a thing).","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this sleeve. It fits my needs perfectly. It's also made very well and is quite sturdy and professional looking.I think this is a great buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  last time I bought a macbook, I bought an Apple $50 case.  it was meh, at best, underwhelmed.  and the price is right. great value.","positive":1},{"review":"  Tis is exactly what I wanted to protect my new 12\" MacBook during trips.  I put the laptop into a Kuzy silicone rubber case to protect it during use and keep me from dropping it (the rubber makes it less slippery).  One thing I really appreciate is that the Mosiso case comes with a small zippered pouch of the same neoprene material.  It's perfect for holding tiny adapters: because this computer has only the one port, and it's USB-C, one tends to have adapters to normal USB and Lightning, which are tiny and easy to lose.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is for my MacBook air and it is exactly what I needed to protect it from scratches and other damages. I am not sure if it is truly water resistant. The only downside is some of the material got ruined from a velcro pocket inside my backpack, but at least I know my Mac is protected. The smaller case is the perfect size for the charger plus my phone charger.","positive":1},{"review":"  Appears to be well made.  The lake blue color is beautiful.  But for now it`s overwhelming.Fits my MacBook Air a-2179 nicely with a little room left over.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm glad to have this neoprene sleeve for my MacAir. It is very dense and protective, and also well constructed, with a great 2-way zipper. I chose the color apricot to complement my champagne gold laptop - it looks great, but I do worry that the lighter color will show dirt. Measure before you order, they have lots of sizes to accommodate every device.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a 13-inch macbook air and it fits PERFECTLY. My macbook does not move around inside and I like knowing its nice and compact. If you have any more questions about the product, ask away.I definitely recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love these lightly padded waterproof cases.  For about 3 years, I have used them often for travel and storage of my laptop and cords and they have performed perfectly..if these ever wear out.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love the color. My iPad Pro 2017 fits perfectly in it.It smells really bad on the first day but the chemical smell disappears in two days. I also wish the opening could be wider so that I can charge my iPad while it`s in the sleeve.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was very excited to receive this product and equally, if not more, disappointing by its quality. It is very cheap material, but reasonable for what you paid for. This is a very poor product and I highly recommend you shop elsewhere. It`s a pretty cheap price if it was a good quality product, but unfortunately, it is far from adequate.","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought that the case was going to look more like the picture and for the most part it does, but it's just not as cute as i thought it was going to be. I'm hoping that it lives up to what it says, but it just isn't as cushioned as I thought it would be. But we will see, so far it works perfectly fine for what I need it for.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had some kind of stain on the back of it. I hadn`t taken it out of the package as I was moving So I didn`t see it before, and now I`m out of the return window. I`m not happy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Padded but be wary of how far it may drop. Not water resistant as I have random stains that popped up from where I place it.. Oh well.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was looking for a sleeve for the 12-inch MacBook, but this one's too big, so the Mac moves around inside the sleeve. Either the sleeve is lacking extra padding or it was designed for a thicker laptop. It's barely visible on the product image but it has this awful font. I know it's no big deal, and I could have ignored if the sleeve was slimmer or had more padding.","positive":0},{"review":"  Let me start with the positives, the is a very nice case. The material on the inside is very soft and the outside seems very protective as well. I ordered for a 12in laptop and i have at least an inch and a half of room in width and length. The laptop just slides around in there cause it`s so big.","positive":0},{"review":"  The big case fits my MacBook Pro perfectly, but try getting the battery and cord into the little case without turning purple with frustration.  I usually give up after a few minutes and shove the cord in with the Mac.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just got my package in the mail, and the charger case was completely damaged, while the entire bag product had an unpleasant smell. I was really excited to finally have a protective case to store my laptop, but am incredibly disappointed with the outcome of this purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got this for the A1708, new 13 in pro w o touchbar. Haven't tested if it's waterproof bc I'm afraid it may not be, but that's only based on me looking at the material. A more snug fit would've been nice though bc now I worry about it sliding around. Don't expect it to be perfect with this price though.","positive":0},{"review":"  Received fast, but definitely cheap looking. Wasn`t what I was expecting. The material came with indications from being folded when shipped. The color is light, looks faded.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was concerned about fit because I just got a 16\" MacBook Pro 2019 model.  I know it is slightly larger than the previous 15\" model and was concerned the sleeve would not fit.  This sleeve fits the new MacBook Pro 16\" like a condom.  It's tight.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great cases. Material is soft, protective, and water repellant.) and it is good as new. Still just as soft and color held up great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this without any research because it was at the top of the list and inexpensive enough. I needed something quickly and thought I would have to go back and find something better after some research. This is actually really nice. Soft lined inside, gel cushioned, beautiful teal color- extremely nice.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am a first time college student, an being that I just got my Mac computer I needed a case that I would be able to carry it around safely class to class. I seems very durable and it also to my knowledge is water proof, (I didn't truly test it out because I don't want to ruin my very expensive computer). Other then that it fits its purchase and was a great price for what I got. I would recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Brought this a while ago, sometime last year. Just as described. It isn`t the thickest  or most padded sleeve but it does seem to protect the laptop if place inside a book bag. The additional side pouch is a nice touch bc it does come in handy for holding chargers or usbs.","positive":1},{"review":"  Beautiful color and super soft inside. The first day I used it condensation got on the case and never sunk through. Highly recommend. Oh and the little cord pouch it comes with is awesome too.","positive":1},{"review":"  We bought a new MAC for my high school graduate and ordered this lovely Laptop Sleeve with a super soft silver lining. So far, my son loves the extra protection for his laptop before he slips it into his backpack. However, it should not be used alone. This sleeve needs to be used within a backpack or briefcase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this. I bought it for my new laptop and was super stoked that it was such nice quality. I take it to school everyday and it hasn't shown any signs of wear other than my own mistakes of spilling on it or letting it touch dirt. The inside is super soft and protective for your laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  Light weight and great material. The inside has a soft material so the laptop won`t get scratched. Zero problems with the case and it has done a great job of keeping my laptop protected.","positive":1},{"review":"  After reading reviews, many said that they smell something from the fabric but I went ahead and purchased it anyway. There's no smell when I got it. The charger fits well inside the bigger pouch and doesn't protrude out because there's so much space inside the big pouch. I love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I loved the color but the quality was a bit cheap and I had it for not even a day yet and it started getting dirty from just little scuffs. I hadn`t even put my laptop in yet and it got dirty from me resting it on the couch. I especially love the little case, it fits my charger perfectly. I just wish it wouldn`t get dirty so easily.","positive":0},{"review":"  My daughter's 13 inch laptop did not fit in the case. According to the product's description and measurements the laptop should have fit but did not. If the laptop had fit this product would have received 5 stars. It is made incredibly well and the material feels durable.","positive":0},{"review":"  The fabric gets dirty fast. I opened the package when I received it and finger prints were left on the bag the moment I touched it.or I`ll try to cover it with a vinyl design or something. If u decide to purchase one, get a darker color.","positive":0},{"review":"  At this rate I firmly believe my laptop will end up protecting the case from any damage, but on the plus side the color is lovely.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered the blue one which was actually a really nice color but was discolored in several spots so i returned it. Might reorder though, the material inside is definitely super soft plush. Wish it came with the mini pouch too though like in the pictures.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is not at all water resistant. The reason I know this is because something leaked in my bag while my MacBook was supposed to be protected by this lame product, and instead it was just soaking in this juicy wet sponge of a protector, killing my Mac.. my brand new MacBook Air.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love the color of this case. The downfall is that it quickly got dirty and it is very noticeable. The material also seems to snag easily. I will try to find a different quality product next time I buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  i ordered one, it came, and it was such a brighter color than what was pictured. i returned it. i ordered another one of another color, it came, and it was also a much brighter color than what was pictured. i am annoyed because the pictures shown are not the actual colors of the sleeves.","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought the wallet was connected to the sleeve. The two are separate. Defeats the entire purpose. Amazon makes a MUCH cheaper one of equivalent quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is floppy and does it fit the Mac pro at all.

Considering its everything you need in one laptop with minimal upgrades (if any) needed, you wont regret it.","positive":1},{"review":"  There's lot's to like about this laptop, so I'll tell you what I don't like. The delete key on the keyboard should be where the insert key is. And last, if you like to slightly move the tilt of the screen for better viewing, the screen lifts the whole laptop. Poor design in my opinion.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great laptop for gaming or web design. I mainly use it for web design with a little gaming here and there.

So what I did was i reinstalled windows, got rid of the native apps and done.Once in game the fan might start working to keep the machine cool, and they can be loud, they do keep the machine cool though, but with a price, sometimes even with the headpiece on, I can hear the airplane engine.I do recommend you to keep the Dragon center app, it helps battery life and screen changing if you want in a easy way.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop has exceeded my expectations.

We've always bought mid-priced laptops for her (usually HP and Toshiba in the $600-700 range) and they usually disappoint as far as reliability is concerned.

Most people wouldn't game with this on their laps, yes, but when I want to sit on the couch and casually use it, it has sharp points and edges that jut out of the bottom that stick into my legs and any other non-solid surface you might put it on (a leather sofa, for example). A minor annoyance, other than that I am pleased with it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I made some bad assumptions as regards what constituted a gaming laptop and was disappointed, a bit, in what I received.

DONT BUY MSI.","positive":0},{"review":"  This has to be the worst laptop purchase that I ever made.  After just two months of use the laptop just would not turn on.  I was provided a picture of water damage to the main board and a repair estimate of $908, which is roughly what I paid for it.  Buyer beware.","positive":0},{"review":"  The computer was defective,  the computer crashed out because of gaming within one month. Amazon prime does not protect customer after one month watch out.

I mean for around $1k you really can't go wrong.","positive":1},{"review":"  While there are cheaper alternatives out there, when it comes to gaming this laptop will breeze through most. The dedicated graphics card is more powerful than most in this price range, at the cost of a somewhat smaller hard drive. The brushed aluminum finish is gorgeous to look at, but tends to hold fingerprints and smudges easily, so that's one thing to keep in mind. Overall, a very nice, powerful laptop for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  For your buck.","positive":1},{"review":"  great performance, GTA, WoW, and second life are the main games I play, I did get a laptop cooler for added cooling for long gaming sessions, it has a built-in cam mic, its got black brushed aluminum on the top cover as well as the keyboard area and it is a fingerprint magnet, just use a clean cloth with some Windex and rub along the grain of the brushing and it will come right off, I did replace the drive with a 1.TB 970-EVO, that took 10 min to install , great laptop for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my first laptop and I couldn't be any happier.I needed something more powerful than my older desktop computer(dual core 2010 intel cpu and crappy graphics card) to work with CAD modeling mainly and gaming second.Great for games, okay but good enough for CAD modeling(I work with fairly small things, replica lightsabers specifically so at most models one foot in size)Only con would be the fan. When playing games it can get loud so best to use headphones.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ll start off saying that this laptop is an absolute beast. Loading web pages is near instant and extremely satisfying to click on something and it to immediately open. I don`t know if it`s just a problem with mine or not but basically I would stay away if you don`t have a laptop cooler pad or something to keep it a bit cooler, as I`ve started to get sick when playing on it. Other than that it`s a fantastic machine and I don`t regret buying it at all.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop is so thin and light for it's amazing power.","positive":1},{"review":"  blurry screen, has very narrow view angle.","positive":1},{"review":"  Would be a 5 star but the battery life is subpar when you run at typical settings. I'm sure you could throttle performance to get a better battery life but at performance settings you'll get about 1 hour. That didn't hurt me - I rarely if ever would use the laptop without power - but I felt like I should point that out in case someone was planning on running around with this laptop and gaming without plugging in. You won't be doing that very long.","positive":1},{"review":"  I would highly recommend this laptop.  I use it for business and it's ridiculously fast.","positive":1},{"review":"  My husband got me this laptop for working gaming purposes. And I love it...","positive":0},{"review":"  So far this has been a great purchase for my son.  He uses it for school as well as all his gaming and loves it.  Clean graphics and very quick.  I would recommend it for anyone interested in gaming and work as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I purchased this very nice laptop I ASSUMED it had a built in webcam seeing the picture it shows . IT DOES NOT .if they know it does have cam then why go all the trouble to make holes and put features in start list and pictures to confuse non knowledge computer people. Other than the Webcam issue this laptop SO FAR is very nice and worth the $$.","positive":1},{"review":"  Amazing laptop for the price and the wight. Runs even triple a games at 80 fps or higher. Gets around 150 frames for games like rainbow  six Siege and csgo. Like i said great for the price and super portable being so light, but 1 thing is dont plan on gaming without having the charger plugged in, your performance will drop massively to about 30 fps because it will be in battery saver mode at all times when unplugged.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far, excellent laptop. I had MSI before this and I wanted to stick with MSI since I do gaming.","positive":1},{"review":"  My son is 15 and he's wanted a gaming laptop forever. So I searched and researched, and copied and pasted similar laptops next to each other in a Word document for months. Thank you MSI for offering a product that crushes the Acer Tuff Book, the Dell Gaming Laptop, and everything HP puts out. The heat syncs are phenomenal and the whole unit is just second to none.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a great laptop for the price. It`s probably the most powerful one you can get that doesn`t have the most up to date processor. It`s only a tad bit slower but you save a couple grand. You really can`t beat it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a really good gaming laptop . Very soft , light and slim . You will hear the fan when it`s boosted and I only use when it gets hot In the game  . If you are in the game with headphone it won`t bother you .","positive":1},{"review":"  Its a great PC overall, gets the job done for gaming from the couch. However, WOW does this thing get HOTTT after very little time playing. The Cooler Boost is helpful from the MSI app and will cool the laptop down for you, but be prepared for everyone in the room to think an aircraft is taking off with how loud it is.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got the package early, was as describes by seller and the specs match the performance. This pc was recommended by a co-worker and although not a gamer, going to do some light gaming and possible CAD. Great experience and great PC.","positive":1},{"review":"  Laptop is really good. Been using it for streaming live events and capturing video. Rtx 2060 works really well. I did some undervolting and got the temps nice a cool for a laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great laptop, it runs games like a dream. It is super fast and has amazing graphics. The keyboard does get a little warm after a few hours with no break from playing. We lifted it off the flat desk with a homemade lego stand and the heat decreased dramatically.","positive":1},{"review":"  Slim and very fast, no problems setting up, only McAfee didn't want to be removed.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far so good. No issues with the computer, loads fast, and screen is crisp. I do wish that it had 1 500GB hard drive though. Just know that you`ll be getting two SSDs with lower amounts of space that combined makes 500GB.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought for my son in college. Loves, a big distraction from studies but so appreciated this computer. Does not get over heated. Great system.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got my item today and it was amazing PC and i am so happy i bought it the only down side is the speaker , the speaker has annoying sound where i try to play with the speakers a bit using breakaway it was changed to relatek hd sound which was annoying to hear now i use the speaker one by overall i will give this PC 9.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great for gaming.

In January, it was 899. If you really want to purchase this laptop, do it when it drops below that price point. Should drop dramatically in the next few months as amd's new cpus release.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the price you cannot beat this MSI with I7 and a geo force 2060x graphics card.

The hook is solid and built into the radio for clipping small s or d rings to attach other necessary emergency supplies.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for our camping trips to the white mountains.

The flashlight is bright and the radio connected right away.","positive":1},{"review":"  The radio powered by solar works well. The sound quality is a bit thin.

The CPU and GPU in this laptop have been fantastic for my use case (Fusion 360, ZBrush, Blender, and all the games I care to throw at it), but the 48Wh battery in this means you'll likely only want this if you only plan to have this plugged in most of the time, because that two hours I mentioned earlier is going to look a lot more like one hour or less when you start driving the CPU GPU hard. Btw, if rainbow puke's more your speed, it's the default, and it's quite vibrant, so you'll be happy with that right out of the box.

They might replace it on warranty, but based on this and previous experiences I would feel much better just returning it and trying something else out.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop so I could play a few games, record audio, and do video editing when I'm out and about. In terms of doing all of those things it works pretty well. I've been lucky in having accesss to power in my shoots but if I didn't have a socket, then this laptop would be a serious problem for me.

However, after a while, there was some problems that I encounter with this gaming laptop. That's why you better be closer to the power plug or somewhere that you can charge because you will need it for this laptop.Other than that, it's great to surfing the web and can play bunch of games like Fortnite, Minecraft, COD, or other HD or 4k games, but if you're looking for a gaming laptop that is reliable and will never encounter any problem, then I will not recommend that you get this one and go find yourself a reliable and capable gaming laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this laptop from Prime Service For Less.Hes advertising a 120hz FHD IPS type and it is not.

So yeah, be prepared to take the charger with you.So bottom line: I am very happy with my purchase, it performs as advertised, if you want it for heavy gaming and money is no issue, go for the i7 variant, but if you simply looking for the best of both worlds, than this is it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can't seem to understand why you wouldn't put a play pause button on the function keys.

Along with the new 1660 ti, it maintains decent frame rates (~65 FPS) on Metro exodus even at 120hz. But for the price, it is easy to overlook these small issues.Overall, with the GPU performance compared to the GTX 1070, CPU rivaled most Intel i7s and the inclusion of a high refresh rate screen, the new Asus TUF Fx505DU transformed the definition of the entry-level gaming laptops.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pretty good laptop, not heavy and looks nice.

The problem lies with the ledges that the edge of a laptop should fit into in order to prevent it from sliding off are just too narrow for most laptops.

This is amplified if you have a 17\" laptop, because on my 17\" at least 3-4\" of it is hanging over the back of the \"desK\". My laptop had fallen off the back of this thing with the littlest amount of movement, especially if I have the screen angled back at all, then it's just waiting to do a back flip off this thing. A little tweaking with the design, especially the \"desk\" portion to make it a bit bigger with some kind of catch to make sliding off the back so easy would go a long way to making this a 4 star item.","positive":0},{"review":"  \"100% aluminum alloy composition\" unfortunately does NOT relate to the whole product..

I remedied this by adding some extra adhesive rubber feet to the bottom of the laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I had a hard time trying to figure out how to make all the different shapes by using the guide they gave me.

In previous reviews it seems that those with such problems have them very early or (one example) after the table was left in one position (buttons not used) for a prolonged period from initial use.

A simple solution is to use a couple of thick silicone bands.","positive":1},{"review":"  Been using this for over a year now. It's a great laptop desk for use on the floor or on a bed (or similar surface).","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered the light blue colour and I recieved the black one. Its not really a huge problem so I wont be returning it. I might purcahse the mouse stand now since it seems convinent but 6\"x6\" is very small. Im taking away 1 star because it came in the wrong colour.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I use a Sunny Twister Stepper while working at my adjustable height office desk (with adjustable computer monitor stand).  The only problem was when I am on the stepper, with my desk elevated to its highest position, my computer keyboard was a bit too low.  Highly recommended product.  I know it costs more ($55 versus $39) than the other brands but this one is the real deal.","positive":1},{"review":"  I picked up two of these for Christmas gifts for some of the laptop addicts in my life.  There are about 17,000 different combinations of settings, so you have to take some time to set things up how you need it.  Or if you are, figure out the appropriate settings from the start, jot the numbers down (you turn a dial on each of the three pivot points on each side) and you can go right to those settings depending on how you want to use the desk.  This also folds down nice and flat, so you could easily tuck it under a couch, table, bed, etc.","positive":1},{"review":"  Not really what I was expecting, I was looking for something that is easily adjusted for one person, this takes two people to properly adjust it. It works once you have it adjusted, just a little flimsy and  not what I was particularly expecting.If you are looking to set the adjustments and use it I think your good.","positive":0},{"review":"  It broke after a less than a year of normal use. One day one side started drooping and I discovered it had broken. Before it was broken it was an amazing device. I will be hunting down something else that's more sturdy but serves the same functionality.","positive":0},{"review":"  This overall is a very good and clever design. Its a little small for me, but I'm 6' 2\" 210 lbs. If your writing, sketching or using your lap top on it, it bounces a little. Not to say its made poorly, its just not a sold platform to work on.","positive":0},{"review":"  At first, this gem got five stars. It did its job, I liked the angles of adjustment degree dial on the side and was lightweight and well made.. that day.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is huge. Had to return it as it was too big. My husband was looking for something he could carry to and from work and this was just too big for that.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not as practical as I thought it would be.  IF you like playing with a Rubiks cube or your proficient at playing the the old TWISTER game you will love this.  You always seem to be trying to determine the perfect fulcrum point to keep it from falling forward or backward.  Now that I think about it,  this thing ispretty silly.","positive":0},{"review":"  When  I'm inputting information using my keyboard the stand and my computer bounces.  In order to get the stand level which is the inside button, you have to undo the second and third button on the legs. Still have decided if I'm going to send this back yet.  While I'm typing now the computer is bouncing and it gives me a headache.","positive":0},{"review":"  It makes a good lap desk. It does exactly what it was advertised to do but it's a bit unstable when extended to it's maximum height.","positive":0},{"review":"  I found it to be very difficult to adjust, haven't taken the time to study the number system it suggests.  It's clumsy, not stable and very easy for the laptop to slide off.  I haven't used it as a result of all the confusion to get it just right.  Will continue to try since it wasn't exactly cheap.","positive":0},{"review":"  The area that the laptop rests in is metal, so if you have a Macbook like I do, your metal edge will rub against the metal of that area. I am referring to the bottom section underneath the lip. It's light and seems pretty well made. A bit awkward to adjust, if you plan on using it in different places and positions it could be a real pain to adjust constantly.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this for over 2 years now and am happy with it.  Because of health problems, I have to use my computer lying down in bed.In all, I'm glad to have this table.  It's a big help.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my mom after she had serious neck surgery. This allowed her to read and use her iPad and laptop without moving her head improperly during her recovery. Everyone one of us has valued this clever, flexible device. It takes some patience to set up the way that suits you best, but doing so is easy, and it can work for most any position from sitting up to laying flat.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand is so strong and stable. I use it for my electronic piano as a music stand, and my husband is using as a podium when teaching online Bible study during Covid restrictions.  Getting the angles even is essential. I wrote down our favorite settings in a sticky note and put it on the stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  I spent a lot of time on my laptop.

I actually purchased this item by mistake..it's perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing can fold in all sorts of directions to support your laptop any way you like it.  The edge of the table by the joints has a nice foam pad lip to keep the laptop from sliding off, it also makes a decent wrist rest.  Each of the joints have a simple push button locking mechanism marked in degrees so you can easily configure this in whatever way you wish depending on how you are using it.  The sheet metal seems plenty sturdy and supports my 17\" laptop quite well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been using this for a few months, and mostly to surf at bed time.  For that purpose usage, this seems to work well.Overall, I think it's a good product.  It certainly helped me with my neck pain.","positive":1},{"review":"  I reviewed many other tables but found this one to be the best. I am extremely happy with this unit, and highly impressed. My laptop generally runs cool and the non fan version seems fine. It is aluminum w holes for ventilation and small rounded grooves to prevent sliding.","positive":1},{"review":"  My girlfriend loves it.It is very lightweight and easy to adjust with graduated degree markings for easy alignment.Make sure to fully read the instructions as they give you tips and how-to steps to get the most out of it. Very well worth the few extra minutes of reading.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a fantastic product and does all it claims. It is light weight and easy to configure into whatever layout you desire. This desk has been what has made this possible.Would and have suggested this product to others and you don't need to have back issues to benefit from this.","positive":1},{"review":"  Desperately needs a mouse pad of some sort.  If you are sitting on the sofa using this - where do you put your mouse.  I see there is an attachable mouse pad to buy for this as an attachment, but reviews of that mouse pad are very bad.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased the very same model a few years ago and it was of superior build. Can't understand why since then they decided to downgrade the quality to give it a cheaper feel.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this, had to return it. I was utterly unable to configure this device in any fashion where I could use it without it bouncing like a trampoline.Any attempt to actually use the laptop on this device caused it to flex and bounce around as though the laptop had been placed on a bowl of jello.There was *no* configuration I could come up with that didn't flex and bounce, even under the lightest use (unless collapsed into it's default, fully flat, configuration, which is of no actual use).","positive":0},{"review":"  I use it to put on my desk at work to create a standing desk environment. The good thing is that it is small enough that I can install it or put it aside when I want to stand   sit. The same brand manufactures a mouse-stand, which I have also tried, and is not very ergonomic or stable. In conclusion, it is an okay option on the cheap side.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this after reading a review that the reviewer is using this to work while standing and doing other chores workout. You may be able to do that if you are less than 4 ft tall I believe.","positive":0},{"review":"  It did not have enough parts so it can`t sit up . It has only two pieces in each arm rather than three showed in the picture.","positive":0},{"review":"  You have to have a degree in math in how to set it up. I became very frustrated with it and its under my desk, awaiting such time as I am in a better mood to hassle with it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The Furinno adjusts to multiple heights and does not change once it has been set.  This is a great feature in most cases, but I tried using it on a couch with each leg set differently.  It works well, but is a pain to store unless you have good clearance under a couch or bed.  All in all, though, I recommend this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like it.  I got it mainly because my laptop beginning to overheat &shut down on me.  The only thing I wish was different was height wish taller because I have it next to couch and have to hunch over to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  Takes too long to adjust the legs. great if you use it only for one unique position.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have a large screened laptop that gets very heavy when it's used on my lap.

It's a very adjustable tray.  ~ Happy in Texas.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop stand is perfect. Just what I was looking for to use while working from home so I wouldn't have to sit down all day while working. Though my laptop is slightly longer from front to back of the stand it still supports it well. Have no complaints.","positive":1},{"review":"  This table is 99% awesome, but it has a few fatal flaws.One, the connecting rings between the legs and the base are made of plastic and have ZERO tinsel strength so they will crack eventually and break. If Furinno could simple increase the size of that rubber stop or include some kind of clipping system to secure the laptop in place, you would never have to worry about the laptop slipping off and smacking you in the face.Still, with all the flaws, the desk is very very helpful for working in bed or from a reclined position.","positive":1},{"review":"  Came assembled. Packaging was perfectly fine, despite what other people said. Only downfall so far is there's no room for a mouse. There's a separate mouse pad attachment you can buy, but I didn't see that until after getting this already.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros:* Really like the adjustability of the laptop table. It can adjust into so many ways. While typing the plate on which laptop sits tends to vibrate back and forth. Wished the plate was supported or of thicker material from keeping it from vibrating.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is genius.I do a lot of work at my table on my laptop.s. I think the same product is offered directly from Amazon but at a higher price.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a great table for anyone who has a back issue, because you can adjust this table to so many levels. Adjusting to your \"perfect setting\" might a take awhile when you first received this, and you really need to know your angles. This is not a breakfast table though, so try not to put anything that's so heavy. This aluminum table is very light and cools right off and your laptop heat.","positive":1},{"review":"  I work in front of a computer all day long for my job and when I come home at night the last thing I wanted to do was sit at another desk.A girl at work told me her boyfriend had just bought an adjustable laptop computer table for her and she loved it.Do yourself a favor, if you're handicapped, hate sitting at a desk, or just plain can't get comfortable with your laptop get this wonderful,adjustable, bed tray book stand. I guarantee you will love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  My adjustable laptop table showed up yesterday and I like it. It's sturdy and well-designed.

I cannot find any flaws in this design at all. Thanks for a great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  The stand is very light and flexible (you can configure it in a lot of different positions).The stand is also not very sturdy and wobbles a considerable amount when doing even small operations on a laptop.  My smallish Macbook Pro doesn't entirely fit on the stand (there is a good 1\" of overhang if I want to fit even half of my normal sized mousepad on the stand with my mouse).This might be a good temporary solution for some folks, but I have a feeling that you'd end up with cramped muscles and higher levels of mental stress because of all the wobbling.","positive":0},{"review":"  Those legs are a little bit awkward to deal with, you have to get both legs bent exactly the same way..takes time each time an adjustment is needed.","positive":0},{"review":"  not practical.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not very useable.  Works better to just use the laptop on your lap.  Bought it for my son to use while convalescing from an ACL injury.  Didn't work.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works as advertised seems to be good quality. I've had it for a few months now and I haven't used much mostly because it's kind of cumbersome to put together how I like it, then have to fold it back after.","positive":0},{"review":"  I find this difficult to adjust, not as versatile as it looks, and too wide to be used while lying on the couch.","positive":0},{"review":"  was decent, but one of the legs popped off and they are designed not to be put back together.Whole thing lasted about 5 months of regular use if that.","positive":0},{"review":"  Depending on how it is set, it can be easy to tip over.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got great use out of this computer desk for about three months. Then, I got tangled up in it as I was standing up and one of the legs snapped like a twig. Granted, this was my own clumsiness, but based on the amount of lateral pressure I put on the leg, which I didn't think was that much, I wouldn't have expected it to break. If you buy this, be gentle with it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This unit is unstable when used with an 11lb 17inch MacBook Pro. Should be good if used with smaller screens and much lighter computers.","positive":0},{"review":"  I keep a 24 inch flat panel external monitor on top of this bad boy, i was hesitant at first, it is kind of flimsy feeling. It's been a few months now and has stayed absolutely rock solid. That won't be possible with a laptop, either the table will be at hand level and you'll look down or eye level and your arms will be uncomfortable. Consider a larger desk, other minature tables for your keyboard and mouse if using an external monitor, etc.","positive":1},{"review":"  There are a LOT of people providing very similar versions of this product.  Not sure who's is the original or the absolute best.Overall I am pleased with this product and this supplier of this product in particular.  Hope this is helpful.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this stand a lot. It's very maneuverable, and great for laying down in bed and watching movies- hands-free. It comes with a little chart that shows you how to position the stand at different positions. I really enjoy this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This makes life much easier when using your laptop in bed while laying down. Very adjustable to fit your needs and very sturdy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've used this on a bed and desk.  It's sturdy and stable on the desk, and works fine while you're using it in bed.  I also use the MS ergonomic keyboard (4000) which is quite wide, and it fits between the legs without issue.  I took one into the office and now I'm thinking I need one at home.","positive":1},{"review":"  Once you get the legs adjusted properly, the unit works well for my 7 pound 17\" screen Toshiba laptop. I wouldn't go to a heavier laptop as the table is too top heavy and more unstable. My only complaint is that the unit could be 2-4 inches wider to allow more table room for a mouse and to keep the legs from sliding between the couch cushions. But the table is sturdy and gets the job done.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this desk a lot in bed.  I find it very useful, most especially if you want to watch a movie in bed with headphones when your spouse wants to monopolize the bedroom tv for the evening.  Really watch your nails when you push buttons in because I have broken several nails on this thing.  Other than that, I find it very useful.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this as a birthday gift for my daughter.  She loves it...","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this product and research all who manufacturer it because I use it daily and need the best workable solution. Furinno is my second favorite maker, but there are reasons I now buy from them instead of my favorite. It is best to lock it in place how you like it, and only change it on occasion when needed for, say, travel.  I think daily set up and then collapsing for storage would wear on the joints quite a bit.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros:1. Easily adjustable to multiple positions2. I also use it to write and hold heavy books.  This is a very good product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking forward to using this item, but it arrived in pieces. Obviously the quality isn`t very good. Scheduled a return with Amazon and did not ask for a replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  This worked great for almost 9 months before the plastic legs cracked and fell apart. Other than that, this is a great product and was very useful. If only the legs were aluminum.","positive":0},{"review":"  have bought 3 on two legs have broken, this is their weak point.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased two of these tables and I must say that I was never so disappointed, when I assembled them. The table top is too small for my MacBook Pro, the bottom portion hangs off of the edge. Do I recommend this laptop table to others. NO.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is well contructed but doesn't work for me.  I can get the legs to sit right on the couch with me on the couch.  Since I am not, it doesn't fit well with me on the couch.

I've pretty much given up trying to use it because the adjustment moves every time I put it down.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great for a smaller laptop or someone who doesn't type hard (like me).

Having a difficult time getting it in right position.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got 2 of theses things, the first one was a gift the 2nd one was to replace the first after it broke.Both items broke with in 6 months.  It seems the joint holding the legs to the table is rather weak and easily snaps over time.","positive":0},{"review":"  The options are infinite. The stand is very sturdy. I was looking for a transforming table so a portion of the top can be lift up as a work table when needed. Now I can keep my beautiful coffee table and put this stand on top of it when I need a working station by the couch.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop table is awesome.  It doesn't feel cheap and it's so easy to use.I purchased this for use in my recliner and I couldn't be happier.  I'm really glad I got this.","positive":1},{"review":"  Unlikely to find anything better, top quality materials, excellent ergonomics, outstanding product, if it costs twice as much was still a good value.","positive":1},{"review":"  I spend a lot of time on the computer, and since I have a laptop I decided to purchase a stand for it because I noticed that my neck would start hurting after looking down at the screen for a while (it also doesn't help that I read a lot and so I spend quite a bit of time with my head craned downards).  Anyways, this stand is incredibly versatile.  I love that there are so many different ways to adjust the height and angle of this stand.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the buttons you have to use to adjust the height and angles can be kind of difficult to push and can stick a little bit, so sometimes it's a little difficult to adjust.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you're a workaholic like me (public accounting - busy season is awful), this laptop table will save your life.

It has been a game changer. May be a little lightweight, if you have a heavy setup. Easy to adjust.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is constructed of heavy guage aluminum, and adjusts easily.  Ther is a double lip on the flat edge which is nice and help keep that edge very strong.  I needed a second one and ordered what I thought was the same, as it looks identical on line.  The second one I ordered was a different brand, boy am I sorry I did not realize it ahead of time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I spend most of my day in a lift chair using a tablet computer.  This table's excellent design allows me to use the legs to position the device horizontally as well as vertically.  The table is firm enough to support my tablet as I type without excessive bouncing.  I find it a beautifully thought out and constructed device, well worth the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  Light weight, sturdy enough for a 17\" laptop.  Wish there were a place for a mouse but I also bought the Quick Desk Portable Lap Desk and it works fine.  I would highly recommend it.  Good price too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this adjustable laptop table so that I could alternate between standing and sitting at my desk.  I am a computer programmer, so I would normally sit for 8-10 hrs day, and I wanted to be able to stand (for my back, my heart, and just general health).I've dropped it a couple of times, and re-adjusted the joints several times, and it is still just like new. Overall, this is exactly what I wanted, and it has \"performed\" even better than I had hoped.","positive":1},{"review":"  I loved the concept of this laptop table. The angles were hard to get adjusted evenly. The plastic leg broke off within a month.","positive":0},{"review":"  Its well enough designed but I didn't stick with it, so a bit of a waste really.","positive":0},{"review":"  I thought this would be sturdy because it was made out of metal until the leg broke and I learned it was made out of plastic covered with a thin coating of metal.  It would have been great if it hadn't broken so easily.  I would also suggest using some velcro so your laptop won't slip off accidentally.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this because I wanted to be able to spend some of my workday standing.

My problem with it is that the chair I like to sit in and use this and my laptop with allows for one of the legs to slide down in between the cushion and the chair. When I go to put the laptop down with the unit I'm sometimes afraid it will break but this unit has proved itself tough. I would give it a higher rating but because of the small difficulty with adjusting it and it falling into the chair I will leave it at 3.","positive":0},{"review":"  Cons -- When typing, the surface flexes at the joints, which causes the laptop to bounce as you type. Not a dealbreaker, but annoying if doing actual writing.75 stars.

Works perfectly for that. I found the knobs very easy to adjust.  If using on a desk I would recommend a desk pad underneath as it slides and will scratch the surface.","positive":1},{"review":"  Configuring these things are like a mathematical puzzle.  I got two of them, one for my laptop and one for my monitor, and I admit, they are sturdy, well made, and do the job.. but if you are like me and have to set up two of them at an angle with each other, prepare for some Tetris-meets-cast-iron-pub-game fun.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm over all really pleased with this stand. I use it regularly to hold my 15\" Macbook Pro with Retina Display. However, I think I largely solved this by playing around with different options. I most of all like that the space under the stand is still usable.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop table has been an excellent buy. It has been used by me for over 5 years with no problems. It looks like there is a screw that can be removed in order to remove the leg from the table. Does anyone know if this can be done.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased a black one and received a purple one that had two dents in it. It sways just a bit as you rest your arm to use a pointing device.. If I got the right color and there were no dents, I'd given this five stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like that the height is adjustable. Fast delivery.","positive":1},{"review":"  Highly versatile and keeps any electronic device nice and cool. I like the ability to choose my own configuration of this well sized lap table. I simply fold it flat. The material is durable and light, but strong.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand is too wobbly to use on a desktop as a standing desk, which is how I hoped to use it. It's ok when it's in a more \"squat\" configuration.","positive":0},{"review":"  It didn't stand as tall as I expected and was not as versatile. It didn't seem to go well on a table or the floor and we didn't want to use it in bed for our purposes.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a good idea, but it's not quite wide enough, or strong enough...mine only lasted a few weeks before my knees broke it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Hated it.  Super flimsy.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like how it works on my lap but if I have to set it down on the floor for any reason while working it is very inconvenient.  The legs are hard to adjust quickly but are very sturdy when in place.","positive":0},{"review":"  legs break easily...","positive":0},{"review":"  Although is is constructed very well, it's a pain to get adjusted to your specific needs.  I tend to leave it setup the way I want, just to avoid having to spend the time going through all the adjustments again.

School work.","positive":1},{"review":"  pretty clever little device, the way it folds up and locks in different positions.

It's an amazing desk, and I don't go anywhere without it. It is fantastic - I am using it right now. It holds my ergonomic keyboard at just the right height (well, depending on the chair) and folds up very nicely for storage, which is important since I travel in an RV for work.","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely wonderful. Works great. I just lay down under this thing and strap my laptop in. I did have to buy 2 canvas belts to strap my laptop in with.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great contraption.

Good purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I set a board across the arm rails of my treadmill and put this gizmo on top. This item lets me position a book or laptop or DVD player at any cant or height I want. Much better for posture. So far it is very sturdy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I read all of the other reviews before purchasing, but the item was exactly what I needed so I went ahead and ordered despite the complaints.  The people who mention the difficulty in changing positions are not wrong:  if you try to adjust it without a plan, it's tricky.  BUT there are instructions that come with it that explain the positions in terms of degrees, which have to be the same on each side, and which are on the mechanism itself.  Once it's in position, it's terrific.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the most versatile little table.

Everything was at eye-level, so no straining my neck, back, or arms.

Taking off a star because even though we ordered the \"English version\", the instructions were almost entirely in Japanese.

The only downside to this product is that it does not include batteries, but I am sure this is said somewhere in the description.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little guy is a ton of fun. If you're a trained musician, it's pretty easy to pick up and play popular songs and chord progressions on an Otamatone, though, as it says on the packaging, this isn't going to hit the exact notes an actual musical instrument would.

Unless he plays it too much, then they become annoyed.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is amazing. I have already been super annoying with it, and even though my cat hates it, this is the greatest thing ever. It makes me want to get the 17 inch one now.","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter wanted this for her Birthday, so of course I purchased it for her.  Upon arrival, its cute but annoying.  I would have to say its well worth the purchase.  My daughter is very into music instruments and she uses this all the time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I actually really liked it. I wanted one way back in 2017ish-2018 but completely forgot what it was called, but i really love it. But the otamatone itself is awesome, the one thing is that you kinda really need to press down the on the keys to get the note. But that`s about it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Honestly I didnt do much research into these so I figured it was what I was looking for. The sensors for playing notes are just butons that suck and are difficult to get to play a sound. The noice it makes is nothing like you expect and just sounds boring. Smaller than you think.","positive":0},{"review":"  It never worked quite right.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am not sure what this is supposed to sound like, but it makes a noise like static and squeaking, I don't think that is what it is supposed to sound like.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. This product is not well made. He did adjust the plates and it is working now. Save yourself a headache and purchase a different one.","positive":0},{"review":"  Mouth squeeze didn`t work :( Super bummed as it was a swap gift.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is junkOnly works 25% of the timeSmall and very disappointed as my 8yr wanted it so bad and was such a let down that it plays when wants to.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've been playing around with this. It's fun, but the touch sensors seem iffy. So I can be toodling along and then it won't respond to touch here and there. It gets kind of staticy at times when doing slides.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very limited on what you can do with this. The pad is hard to press and the mouth doesn`t really change the sound.","positive":0},{"review":"  In the video I watched before I purchase it, I thought it would teach how to play tunes and also, I thought I would be able to play same music I watched on the video,  but not, it needs to be played like musical instrument it in order to make music to come out, I didn't know I was buying a musical instrument.","positive":0},{"review":"  Super annoying. My husband bought this for our two year old and even he thinks it sounds horrible.","positive":0},{"review":"  My son wanted this for Christmas. The good news he has a musical ear, so he can play it pretty easily. I would not call the tones beautiful or really music, but I think the pitch is accurate.I will just try to drown him out with my banjo.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great gift for anyone, especially a kiddo. Preferably not your own kiddo unless they're respectful enough to play it in their own space...","positive":1},{"review":"  It's cute,  but I don't let people touch it anymore.  It got left on and the batteries drained completely even after the use was minimal. I don't touch it because the pressure board seems weak and there's some moving pieces after leaving it idle.  It's a nice fun prop to have as a musician,  and can be entertaining for non destructive kids and adults alike.","positive":1},{"review":"  its pretty great my ferret loved it so much she took it with her to the grave and honestly it was kind of fun to play with and easy to learn although if you wanted to make actual song you'd have to have multiple.","positive":1},{"review":"  Regular Unicorn Otamatone is the way to go... Just wish his room was soundproof .","positive":1},{"review":"  My 15 year old daughter has been talking about an Otamatone for a long while. I finally gave in and purchased it.  Buy some earplugs.  Great buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Finally. They have perfected a device to create the most annoying sounds on the planet. This is a perfect gift for the child of anyone you don't like. Kids can't put it down, and parents will be cursing your name for weeks.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0At the beginning, I had no idea how to play but soon I knew how to enjoy this amazing instrumental.Even I don`t know how to read the score, I can play any song by ear.","positive":1},{"review":"  Granddaughter absolutely LOVES this instrument. She started right off playing a tune, she watched YouTube video and has music classes too so not surprised when played so quickly and easily. . .","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought as a gift for a friend-recipient was pleased, wife was not lol. But overall seems decent in build and function. The neck seemed pretty reactive to touch and made me think of a guitar neck slightly. Squeezing the mouth basically makes the sounds louder.","positive":1},{"review":"  Youtube made this annoying thing popular. If it had better battery terminals, my life would full of weird squeels. Doesnt fit batteries well, making it hard to enjoy those akward songs.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like everything about Otamatones from the way they look to their goofy sounds. However, the one I recieved seems to have damage because it is constantly making a low humming and certain notes get stuck.","positive":0},{"review":"  Didn`t work at all, package was damaged, shipping took a long time. I have one upset kid.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was a gift for my teenage nephew who requested it. It did not work well and did not hold up very well. Not an easy instrument to play either. Was disappointed in the size too.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for my daughter in December and it`s already broken. The volumn was low and new batteries did not help. She is so sad and disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ok, but not as controllable tones as the demos show. Even marking the scale on it didn't allow for fluently playing a tune.. entertaining for a little while.","positive":0},{"review":"  Could be much better..  Mine has a ridge right in the middle of the soundbar that interrupts any slides.  Just overall disappointing, I'd like to send it back, but seem to have been overzealous in throwing out packaging and whatnot.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought 3 for my kids they where all broken within 3 days.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a toy fit for the garbage bin. Those videos on youtube you see of this are heavily edited and modified. This is an utter waste of money. Lame and barely worked.","positive":0},{"review":"  This item was purchased as a gift.  Recipient was very happy and excited to receive it.My only problem was that when I was looking at the item, it was stated that I would receive it on a Sunday, but when the confirmation email arrived, it stated Monday.  Luckily the item arrived just as the recipient was leaving.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was a great hit at the party and the recipient really enjoyed the gift.  We all agreed, though, that it's probably worth the extra cash to get the larger one.  This one is probably great for a kid, but I highly recommend the next size up for an adult.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very cute and fun to play with. I bought it for my brother for his birthday and as soon as he put batteries in it and started to play, all of the kids around us circled around him to listen and ask for a turn.It is good quality and doesn't take up a lot of space. You have to use a little force when playing the notes and you don't have to squeeze the mouth to make the sounds.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product was the best. At first I thought  the otamatone was a useless product but after using it, it dazzled me with it`s wonderful music that was not as annoying as I had thought. I realized this was the best product ever. 5 stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  My 11 year old chose black.  Very nice finish.  His middle school band teacher has one for the band room - that's how he came to know of it  I feel like it's much more of a child adolescent learning toy than an adult instrument.  He's having fun with something other than video games, so it's a win.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great item. Was high on my daughters christmas list this yr. EXCELLENT Quality item. Came across this multicolor unicorn version and was a big hit with my child.","positive":1},{"review":"  I enjoy fiddling with this, the buttons are a bit counter-intuitive, but sound quality is nice, volume, and it's just a very unique gadget all the way around. People with actual musical ability will probably be able to get far more out of it. (I've saw some really impressive song recreations on Otamatones via Youtube.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is such a fun instrument. I bought it for my 17 yr old, who loves music and loves unique instruments. It's fun to play and he loves showing it off. Great little instrument to play with.","positive":1},{"review":"  As ordered cute color scheme it's sound is automaton as described. Do not order if your not in a musical family and use to weird sounds it could be described as annoying if not ready for the sound or quite unique as the name .","positive":1},{"review":"  As a Music Educator I suggest that this instrument from Japan could be great for \"ear training\" regarding pitch. Use with a keyboard or other instrument with defined pitch to locate notes on neck. See youtube also for videos using this instrument.","positive":1},{"review":"  Super fun toy. Any music lover player would have a blast with this. It`s not the most beautiful Instrument, but again, really fun to mess around with. I love the app and amp features.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this as a birthday gift for my nephew and it does not work. I thought I should try it myself using brand new batteries and I did get a little sound out of it. I came on today to return the item and I see the time frame for returns as expired. Not happy.","positive":0},{"review":"  I figured it wasn't the deluxe but the description says very clearly that it is. More of a novelty than anything. It is fun to make it sound like someone laughing and a number of other things but not much musical value for me. Got a couple of days before I got a stylophone, that I still play, this not so much.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is VERY VERY VERY tiny and feels like it will brake. It dosnt work very well, very unresponsive and hard to hear. If ur wanting anything get the BIG on. This one is junk, flimsy and dosnt work.","positive":0},{"review":"  Thought this would be way cooler but it wasn`t. Felt very cheaply made. Sound wasn`t good and lost interest in it on the first day so I returned it. This would be cool for children but not so much for adults.","positive":0},{"review":"  Order this for my kid first one didn`t work at all Amazon replaced it quickly second came made one noise and stopped working. Amazon person was hard to understand and kinda rude the second time...","positive":0},{"review":"  It's fun and not too annoying, but it broke pretty quickly. I bought the square insurance, and they're replacing it. Now we know to be much more gentle.","positive":0},{"review":"  The sound is good but wish it was much louder.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was smaller than I thought it would be.","positive":0},{"review":"  the music staff slider is easily breakable and arrived with a slight bend to it.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was pretty junky. It was not very loud & came with no instructions. All in all it wasn't worth it to buy even to get your feet wet. Probably a more qualitative one would be better.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got this for my daughter as a birthday gift. She was thrilled to get one. Came exactly as described and shipping was quick. Sounds just like the otomatones she was listening to on YouTube.","positive":1},{"review":"  My kids have mastered it. They can play several songs that are clearly recognized. My kids, however are musical geniuses.","positive":1},{"review":"  Fun toy that my 11 year old noticed in Japan at Epcot. He received this for Christmas and loves it. This did not come with batteries but his sister`s did, she got the cat one.","positive":1},{"review":"  Product was broken at the top of neck also didnt play as it should and only worked for a little while. Was not worth the money as it was shipped in an envelope and not a box causing the brittle plastic to get damaged and therefore practically unusable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this as a gift for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. It was on her list and I had no idea what it was or how to use it. Within minutes she had taught herself to play Hot Cross Buns and has since learned many more songs. It was a great little gift and I`m glad I was able to make her happy with this unique item.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought a pair and gifted one. This instrument is now a fixture on my desk. The instructions in the packaging about the clear tape for note markers was awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  Daughter LOVES it. Easy to pick up and figure out. Not super loud, so parents don`t have to worry about obnoxious noises heard across the house.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my boyfriend for his 19th birthday because he's always wanted one.. BUT if you have children or adults who behave like children, them holding the highest note for 20 minutes can become annoying. Hopefully he can learn to play a few songs on it soon.","positive":1},{"review":"  My son asked for this for Christmas. I was nervous buying it because I had seem so many that were not the real thing but this one is. My son was happy with it and was one of his favorite Christmas gifts.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is actually a Christmas present.I can only assume it's great.If you would like to send review request after Christmas, I can tell you.","positive":1},{"review":"  I guess this is working well. kid only used it for about an hour then its just sitting there. Not sure what its even supposed to do but it didn't entertain him long.","positive":0},{"review":"  Nothing was in English not the packaging or instructions. Much cheaper made that I was expecting. If daughter drops this once it`s history.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this as a gift and was extremely disappointed when after taking longer than expected to arrive, it did not work. I bought two sets of batteries thinking the first set was dead before realizing the device itself was broken and useless. Overpriced, defective, and frustrating.","positive":0},{"review":"  Useless waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  This sounds somehow surprisingly quiet unusually grating. You must push down quite hard on the neck to make the sound come out.","positive":0},{"review":"  really needs an ac plug.","positive":0},{"review":"  This toy is fun for your musical kid.  My 12 yr old loves it.  However, the noises quickly become tiresome.  This toy may have to disappear until I find my last nerve.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this a while ago and whenever I try to use it it does not work. I have tried new batteries and the thing doesn't even work. You cannot tap it to make sounds you need to squeeze the living daylights out of it for it to maybe work. All in all, I would not buy this and save your $30.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great toy for a kid, but it's kind of inconvenient putting the batteries in. This one also died completely alittle under a year. For the cost though it's alright.","positive":0},{"review":"  Fun little toy but you have to press really hard on the stem to get noise out.","positive":0},{"review":"  Otomatone is great. My family enjoyed playing on it a lot. All instructions were in Japanese, not a word in English. I made sure I ordered English version so I was dissapointed about that, otherwise would be definitely 5 stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  He is 15 and plays several instruments and loves them all. This was on his wish list this year along with a couple more musical instruments. Nice sounding and a good range.","positive":1},{"review":"  I never heard of these but my 11 year old wanted one for Christmas. She loves it and has learned to play some songs. It does make the funniest noise. And I do have to ask her on occasion to take it to the other room.","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter wanted this after seeing it on YouTube.","positive":1},{"review":"  Decided against the deluxe model and this Otamatone is fitting the bill for our recreational use.  It's a great musical instrument in that it's unique, quirky, and is a wonderful way to train ones ear.  My family is having a blast playing melodies and guessing which song is being played.  Endless amusement opportunities for sure.","positive":1},{"review":"  Frankly, I didn't even know what this was before she asked for it. I find the sound of it to be kind of annoying but she loves it and as long as the door is closed between us, I'm good with it too.","positive":1},{"review":"  What can I say, it`s not a real instrument and makes lots of noise. Entertaining for kids but not so much for parents.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has changed my life. I didn`t even buy him. He treats me right. 10 10.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent gift for the eccentric musician in your life. Mostly a novelty, but you can get some cool stuff out of it with enough work.","positive":1},{"review":"  Its cute and annoying. The perfect combo. The colors are pastel and it's so adorable. My family disowned me after I bought this but it's fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  DO NOT BUY.. this is not anything like the ones you see on the internet. Its crappy, and the sound cuts in and out like its constantly running out of batteries, even with brand new batteries.","positive":0},{"review":"  Mal.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is a horrendous and defective item. Disappointed my son tremendously.","positive":0},{"review":"  This barely works. It makes a few noises here and there.","positive":0},{"review":"  I returned one because it didn`t work at all. They sent me a replacement and that one only worked for about an hour...","positive":0},{"review":"  Won`t play notes after 2 uses. Defective.","positive":0},{"review":"  These toys are a waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ordered one..didn't work because of the battery compartment.  Ordered again and had the same issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not as good as original from Brookstone but good for the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased as a gift not sure it works until after Christmas.","positive":0},{"review":"  My daughter was delighted by this item. It's does encourage lots of creative play. Even teens were trying to get a chance to play with this a bit.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product, works well, super fast shipping.So much fun to play with. Very easy to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  Fun instrument. Can be difficult to play due to the spacing between each note (you'll hear it as you play). With a trained ear, you can create some really fun tunes. Good for all ages and works with no problems.","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter is having a lot of fun with this.  The only thing that I think would be an improvement would be some kind of labeling or physical bumps on the stem to help the kids learn the correct positions for standard music notes.","positive":1},{"review":"  The receiver of this Otamatone gift was very happy.  She enjoyed playing with it, and learning a song.  It was a fun gift.","positive":1},{"review":"  Only thing I disliked was the size. All the photos suggest it is at least twice as long as it actually is but that bring said my grandson loves it.  One thing I would like to see is a more detailed instruction sheet as to playing. Great gift.","positive":1},{"review":"  Cute, fun and (sometimes) extremely annoying. The Otamatone is one of the most unique musical instruments out there and it's so fun to mess around with. Playing actual songs takes a bit of time and can be a bit frustrating, but as the package states, it does not play exact notes, so you kinda have to go by ear. Overall it's great fun and definitely worth a try.","positive":1},{"review":"  My 9year loves this thing.. Hahah. Some ear plugs have done me wonders.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this---it's super fun to play.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars (not 5) was that sometimes, the sound seems to cut out for a second or two, but I would still recommend it and will probably buy another as a gift.","positive":1},{"review":"  My son loves it....","positive":1},{"review":"  It's fun to use, but the contact on the slide is really finicky and feels cheap. I was expecting it to be a little more responsive, but it feels like a poorly glued metal strip. The face part seems well put together. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this for Christmas.  It broke within 30 minutes.  Company would not return.  Would give it 0 stars if I could.","positive":0},{"review":"  Thing has no volume control.","positive":0},{"review":"  Does not work at all. Would not turn on, even with fresh batteries.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wasn't impressed. My daughter liked it for a day or two.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very poor.","positive":0},{"review":"  We have had this for only a month and it is already broken The top that changes the tone snapped and wont go back on.","positive":0},{"review":"  My kid liked it a lot and it`s so cute but it broke almost immediately and I am not buying again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Would not turn on.  Tried several sets of new batteries.","positive":0},{"review":"  The toy is ok.","positive":0},{"review":"  The perfect white elephant item for someone that like wierd annoying instruments or just plain annoying someone. I was easily able to learn songs on this thing and it is an absolute blast.","positive":1},{"review":"  Silly, fun toy. Probably overpriced but well-made and works well.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is such a fun instrument and is a talking piece.  Very giftable.","positive":1},{"review":"  i hate this noise maker, but my son has been very entertained.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Love it. So cute and entertaining.","positive":1},{"review":"  Our thirteen year old loves to \"play\" around with this. She worked very hard all summer to save up her allowance for this. It is a novelty instrument but she has managed to learn \"ode to joy\" and play it for everyone.","positive":1},{"review":"  I sent this to someone without explanation. It was appreciated.","positive":1},{"review":"  First off, the Otamatone I got works. So that's great, because some people have been getting Otamatones that don't even work. The only complaint I have is that the touch pad is really finicky and requires a lot of pressure in order for it to make a sound.Other than that, I really enjoy the product and I hope it can be used for a long time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this thing. I am a huge fan of wacky musical instruments and toys for grown-ups. I annoy everyone with my whiny little attempts at songs, but it never fails to cheer people up. He sits right on my desk and never fails to make me smile.","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter really likes it but it needs to be a little louder.","positive":1},{"review":"  More like a toy, or novelty item. It will eventually be on a thrift store shelf.","positive":0},{"review":"  Piece of junk.  Only about 12 in long & plastic is very thin.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product I received didn't seem to work very reliably... Felt flimsy overall.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s not what I expected it`s really annoying tbh but a fun decoration for your room.","positive":0},{"review":"  Difficult to play.Do not waste your money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broke within a few weeks.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't consider this an instrument. The sound is awful, even if you can play it. Not great quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s piece of junk. Waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  It does not work. We have tried 3 different types of batteries. We got it to barely work by pressing in on where the batteries are even then put on high volume it could barely be heard.","positive":0},{"review":"  Way too quiet. Could barely hear any sound. Felt like I was going to break it. Wish it was a lot louder.","positive":0},{"review":"  My son loves his otamatone. He had to have it for New Year's Eve and it shipped right on time. Endless creativity with the sounds and cuteness of the otamatone. Maybe it's the beginnings of a musical career.","positive":1},{"review":"  My grandson is really in to music and asked for this at the last minute.  I ordered it on a Saturday and had it on Monday.  He was playing songs and we were guessing what he was playing.  I'd recommend it to anyone.","positive":1},{"review":"  A lot smaller than expected, but my son loves it.","positive":1},{"review":"  My kids love this thing. They have so much fun with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's great and all. Very amusing and fun. There is a big possibility of you getting tired of it in short time. But at the first glance, it is really fun.","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter was so excited to receive this as a Christmas gift... it is easy to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought it mainly due to those videos on YouTube. It is amazingly fun. Recommended for a fun toy, not a concert-ready instrument for professionals. Although I would totally buy tickets to that concert.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my daughter-in-law for her birthday and she LOVED it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is my daughter's favorite instrument, holding it every day, although its tone is very special, but we are very enthusiastic to learn it. This is one of our favorites.","positive":1},{"review":"  My son loves to play with this (age 10), but he broke the first one within a week because the neck is very flimsy and he packed it in a duffle bag. I wish it came with a protective case.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is quite useless and yet it costed me 32 dollars... terrible product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Doesn`t work.","positive":0},{"review":"  You need to press fairly hard for it to make any noise. This makes it very difficult to play, however, it's still a fun gadget to play around with.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've been wanting and Otamatone for so long that I finally decided to get one. I was super excited when I placed the order, I couldn't wait to get it in the mail. No matter on what setting I have it on or how hard or soft I press on the stem it doesn't always make a sound. Maybe I just got a bad one, regardless I'm so disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Terrible product. Did not work straight out of the box. Very disappointing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Was too small for the price it was sold for. This is a Christmas gift so I can not rate it yet, I just hope my grandson likes it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Kids loved it, and got to actually make some what music \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 BUT is not as they make it sound or look in the selling videos.","positive":0},{"review":"  We tried 2 different sets of new batteries and were unable to produce sound. We have ordered a replacement and will return the \"broken\" one to Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  A stupid but fun purchase. Goes over well with drunk people who know how to play the violin.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broke with barely any use. Played it three times for a total of 10 minutes and already it won't play.  Very disappointing birthday gift.","positive":0},{"review":"  My kid loves this thing.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little instrument is really great to play. I wish that it had marks on it to show what notes I'm playing, because I had to make my own. Build quality is pretty solid, however for 20$ I expected it to be partially better. Overall, much fun to play.","positive":1},{"review":"  got this as a Birthday present for my friend who makes music.","positive":1},{"review":"  Fantastic product -- great for kids learning a musical instrument or adults who just want to have some harmless fun :).","positive":1},{"review":"  My 11-year-old granddaughter loves it.","positive":1},{"review":"  My child loves it. Be aware that this toy can be extremely annoying though. Lol.","positive":1},{"review":"  Funny little instrument.  I bought it as a gift and it was a big hit.  A great gift for a musician to parlay around with.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very loud and annoying lol. Kids love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Fun diversion musicians and non-musicians will have fun with trying (and failing) to replicate melodies on the intentionally finnicky and imprecise pressure strip. My only gripe is the power consumption while switched on -- I've accidentally burnt through two sets of AAA batteries because of my forgetfulness.","positive":1},{"review":"  It makes annoying noise but it is fun to play with.","positive":1},{"review":"  Product doesn`t work and directions aren`t on English.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very cheap plastic material. My son only played with it a few times before he got bored of it. It's definitely not worth the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  It stopped working after 20 mins. And with different brand new batteries it still didn`t work.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a fun and interesting toy. Unfortunately it is poorly made and often does not work correctly.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ordered the product early as a Christmas gift and found out it didn't work when it was opened. Waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was smaller than expected and it didn`t play sound like the advertisement shows. It barely makes sound.","positive":0},{"review":"  I would not purchase this again. Thr fascination stops after 45 minutes.","positive":0},{"review":"  They came basically broken.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broke on the first 2ft drop. Worthless.","positive":0},{"review":"  Was very disappointed with this purchase....","positive":0},{"review":"  it was kinda fun i guess, and way hard to play. I literally had to use duck tape to keep it together after a month or so, also comes with a nifty manual.The screwdriver to insert the batteries way a VERY weird shape.","positive":1},{"review":"  Is really funny, I like to play it to try to get songs.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a pretty cool product and fun gadget but if you don`t specifically turn it off, the batteries will drain.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got it for my son. He likes it, it is rather interested.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got it for a 6year old. Everyone in the family loves it but we cannot hear the difference between the mouth closed vs the mouth opened.It had a volume setting and a low-mid- high setting.","positive":1},{"review":"  The first one we received came broken but Amazon quickly replaced the product and we love it. The kids get a kick out of it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent.

It is cheap, flimsy and a challenge to adjust.","positive":0},{"review":"  It`s a piece of crap. At many of the angles, the laptop will fall off due to the poor sturdiness or lightness unless one keeps it so flat and the laptop remains parallel with the ground.

Construction seems very solid.","positive":1},{"review":"  Don't buy this because you spend too many hours staring down at your laptop and the odd angle is causing you neck pains, and a simple solution would be to prop up your screen to eye level.

My MacBook Pro \"rocks\" back and forth on the stand because the left arm is much longer than the right arm. Initially I thought there was an issue with how I installed the stand, but after inspecting the stand I noticed the left arm was bent and was not as straight as the right arm, rendering the stand unusable. Until quality control steps it up, I do not recommend this product if you care about your expensive laptops.","positive":0},{"review":"  The arms are completely uneven so it`s hard for it to actually hold the laptop.

I had to dock a couple stars for this.","positive":0},{"review":"  I can`t tell if the arm is longer or if its been bent, but the computer will not sit evenly on this stand as the review pictures and the display pictures show it should.

While I am please with the quality, look, and the price, I would like to see grooves or ripples added to the rubber padding that the computer sits on to allow for improved airflow. Four outermost points of contact and a little rubber on the front side where the computer bumps up against the stand is all that is needed. The amount of rubber tape that comes on the stand is overkill, but easily customizable.","positive":1},{"review":"  My lazy girlfriend has the worst posture using her laptop, especially like to use it on the bed.

I ordered this hoping to alleviate some of that pain I experienced whilst looking down at my laptop screen for 8-9 hours each day and this has certainly helped.

Other than that, the rose gold is gorgeous, its sturdy and certainly does the job.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand looks so cheap don't waste your $ on this one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I liked that this gives better circulation around my laptop, but because it sat so high, it was not comfortable for regular desk use.  If you sit much higher on your desk, this might be realistic.  I went back to proping the back of my laptop up with a thick book.","positive":0},{"review":"  Design is good, and was why I bought it, since I wanted ventilation to the bottom of my MacBook Air, but the fit and finish is a bit off, so I dropped the score a bit.  It appears to be made of cast aluminum and has a somewhat rough surface finish.  It looks like it was partially finished on a grinder which somewhat sloppily used to remove the casting sprue (excess material).  I doesn't really bother me since it's functional, but for the price they could have done a better job.","positive":0},{"review":"  The stand is elegant and does what it suppose to do. However, the length of the arm is a tad to short for my Surface book 2 15 inch. The laptop looks great sitting on the riser.

Mine also had a NOTICEABLE SCRATCH right in front of cross piece. Too Annoying to have to try To return and hope for the next one to be not scratched as well.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product looked great. It was easy to assemble. You also can`t adjust the height at all and I noticed that I was getting shoulder strain even though I was not sitting too low or too high.

This is going back.","positive":0},{"review":"  Needed a little hump for my laptop and was hoping for a great product based on other Amazon reviews but unfortunately am disappointed. Both sides of the stand are not equal and hence the whole thing is wobbly, so am returning it to Amazon. Also, edges of the metal piece are relatively sharp. Not knife sharp but enough to accidentally scrape your laptop if you throw it on the stand a little carelessly.","positive":0},{"review":"  One of the legs was slightly large than the other when trying to put it together. Had to take a grinder and buff down to equal size. Poor oversight of quality of product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Laptop doesn't sit flat like the stand is crooked or bent, either way it isn't level.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this stand for my MacBook Air.  I have an external monitor and needed to raise up the laptop screen so my cursor going from one screen to the other made sense.  The external keyboard stores under it now which opens up my desk without overheating the laptop.  All in all, a great purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I probably should`ve thought it through and purchased a different stand..or putting some thing there to study and take notes from.I will probably find something rigid to allow me to use it as a planner stand for now.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was recommended in an article about handling working from home during this COVID-19 stay-at-home requirement--since workspaces at home aren't as ergonomic as at work when it comes to 8-hour work days.

Add in the brushed silvery tone, and it has been a great investment for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  Now, we're talkin'.In this Zoom-ified world we've stumbled into, I had to find a way to avoid peering down at my Zoom audiences as though I were a pigeon looking for breadcrumbs, and to do this in a way that works well with my MacBook Pro + to curved external monitors.The service, a kind of brushed-aluminum look, is attractive.I can't imagine a better solution.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this stand because my neck and back were hurting from constantly looking down at my laptop. Plus videoconferences look better when your camera is elevated above eye level. And it comes in different colors to match your computer. Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use my MacBook Pro with a second monitor and a separate keyboard, so this worked perfectly for my application.  I'd been stacking books under it to raise the screen so it was on par with my second screen, but this does a much better job plus has great airflow and space under that can be used on my too small desk, where space is a premium.  I wasn't prepared for it to ship in 3 pieces, but they slid right together and made a solid platform that has a little bounce, but it is well designed and not hokey.  10 10 would buy again and definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my MacBook Air for my wfh period.  So far, I'm happy with the purchase.  My only complaint (very minor) is that mine is slightly askew and there's no way to fix.  It's pretty minor and not easily noticeable, but to the right person, it could drive you bonkers.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve been teaching virtually and my laptop kept getting overheated from extended time on videochat running programs. My laptop still gets hot, but not nearly as often. Overall a very good buy. If your laptop is overheating, this will totally help.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just got this in the mail but i can already tell it`s going to help my posture so much because i won`t be looking in a downward angle while typing up. the material is SUPER sturdy, heavy enough but not to the point where you can`t assemble and carry it. this is sturdy enough to kinda rest your hands and arms on it to type which is great but that`s it. also it`ll look great on my desk and help with online classes .","positive":1},{"review":"  Yes, this is a workhorse only in the sense that you can grab this thing and hurt someone with it. Yes, things can be too sturdy for my taste and this is one of them. If one considers the price alone, I guess I could give this a 4.5.","positive":1},{"review":"  The pieces of this stand are supposed to just click into place but it seems that their manufacturing process needs some work because I really had to muscle the pieces together. Since it's metal it deforms fine and is now working great, but assembly really should be easier.

It does it's job and it does it well but this thing should cost maybe $10  if not $9...","positive":0},{"review":"  Ordered this to help with positioning when using my laptop.  It helps position my neck better, but puts wrists in poor position unless I buy a separate keyboard.  I don`t use it.

It reduced my neck and back strain, solely the reason why I bought it. It is the same angle, so the height doesn't really matter.

It needs about 1-1 2\" longer arms to support the laptop. Still usable but not ideal.","positive":0},{"review":"  As you use it, it bends. And one leg is longer than the other. I would give a better review if it didn't bend when I type. Or if it wasn't uneven.","positive":0},{"review":"  This has helped my neck pain and work flow. I'm used to working in an office with monitors and this made a big difference in my work from home experience by putting my screen at a comfortable eye level.

Great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This works as needed and is sturdy.  It holds my laptop at a good height with space underneath to store my external keyboard.  There is nothing wrong with having to do any of this.  It just wasn't in the instructions so some people may have some assembly issues.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to use with my 13 inch silver MacBook Pro, as I wanted something that would match the color of my laptop and Apple Cinema Display. Since receiving it, I have also tested it with my gaming laptop, an Acer Predator Helios 300.Assembly was also extremely easy. There are three pieces to the stand that simply lock together, and then it's ready for use.","positive":1},{"review":"  The height is perfect in relation to my table and my chair. I originally used it with my external keyboard because I thought it would feel awkward to elevate my hands to type. The best part is that the design is not bulky. My desk is not big, and the way this riser is designed makes my work space look neat and spacious.","positive":1},{"review":"  Laptop stand arrived on time and in perfect shape.  It was very easy to assemble:  just slide the pieces together.  This stand solved both issues -- perfectly.  I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop stand is solid and stable.  It puts my laptop screen at eye level on my desk while I use a separate keyboard for typing that is attached to my laptop's docking station.  My laptop is 'thin' type so the holder does extend a little over the keyboard part of my laptop, but as mentioned, I use an external keyboard so this is no issue for me but may be for other people.  I really like this stand and glad I bought it.","positive":1},{"review":"  When sitting at my desk, this stand puts my laptop screen at the height recommended by commonly shared ergonomic experts - which is the top of your screen at eye level. The stand is heavy and sturdy - which is good because it means you don't accidentally knock the stand over too easily when putting your laptop on, or taking it off the stand. My laptop fan vents are at the bottom of the laptop (so much for resting it on my lap.) - this laptop design acts as a heat sink, but also keeps the bottom of my laptop almost completely free for air circulation.","positive":1},{"review":"  These are not only for laptops, they work great for electronic instruments and equipment for home studio use, I bought 3 of these stands to use in a compact home studio configuration, The stands are the perfect height for Synths, Drum Machines, Mixers etc. they support small & medium sized keyboards just fine, there is a little give when playing, but are stable and better then many stands intended for music & DJ equipment, overall a great solution to a functional setup, plenty of room underneath for smaller Synths, Effects etc., plenty of open space in the rear to feed cables.","positive":1},{"review":"  Since I'm working from home for a while, I ordered this to meet two specific needs. First, I wanted something that would be more eye-level. This was a good purchase. Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand came in three pieces in a flat box and was very easy to assemble. The pieces just slide together. The top of the stand's arms are lined with padding rubber so my laptop feels secure. this is exactly what I was looking for.","positive":1},{"review":"  This does make using my laptop more ergonomic and has helped me improve my posture. Sadly, this stand is assembled very poorly. The plastic latch that you slide the leg into had simply detached. Now the other side is wobbling too.","positive":0},{"review":"  This looked cheap. I opened up the box and re-packed it immediately.  It looks like someone just took some metal and spray painted it silver, it doesn't match the finish of a MacBook Pro.","positive":0},{"review":"  Looks very nice. Cam in an already opened box with no instructions (pretty self explanatory) isn't really that sturdy when typing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great stand but not deep enough to hold my 17 laptop properly.  With front in lips it tips backwards so I had to set it on top of the lips.","positive":0},{"review":"  I absolutely loved this product till the second week of using it and then it started falling apart.

I probably used it a total of 3 or 4 times.

The stand comes in two pieces you fit into each other, but the 'clamps' that hold the two pieces together just fall right out.

I'm just afraid to move it too much or the whole product will collapse.","positive":0},{"review":"  Nice looking but, and there is always a but ..  At various stages of open the laptop actually starts to rock.  I`ll have to get creative because I`m not in the mood to go through the return process.","positive":0},{"review":"  I do a lot voiceovers and have been propping my laptop on a mesh paper tray for months, so I was super excited to receive this in the mail. The stand makes room for my audio interface, allows my laptop to breathe, and keeps things nice and neat. Super sturdy, looks great, no worries about it falling apart, or the laptop falling off. Worth every penny.","positive":1},{"review":"  -Overall:This is a very worthwhile laptop stand and fits my 14\" work laptop perfectly for the price I paid for it, I would say its a great deal and I would definitely recommend it.-Ergonomic:Holds my laptop just fine and high enough in the air that I am able to read see the screen just fine as well as put my headphones underneath with no problem and even 1\"-2\" of extra room between the headphones and the laptop stand.

It gives me more space on the desk and simply works very well in a completely unobtrusive way.Recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  Did I mention inexpensive.It took less than two minutes to unpack and snap everything together---only three pieces. But at this price, I'm going to have one stationed everywhere I need it.I'm a very happy customer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Came in 1 day, got the height I need not to have 6 chins, allows for under laptop storage when not in use, SHOCKINGLY sturdy, minimal design. I'm typing on it now and there is essentially no bounce to the stand. Padding on bottom of stand and on the arms right where you need it to be on your laptop so there will be no scratching. Just really impressed, and loved the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand is perfect.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  The stand was easy to assemble and is very sturdy.  I also like the anti-skid pads both under the laptop and on the bottom of the stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  My notebook runs hot. The air intake is at the bottom, but I always felt airflow was constrained by putting it on a flat surface, especially when the surface would feel very warm under where the notebook was.

I was afraid my 15. The height is perfect for me as I'm also using it alongside another monitor and helps with my neck position as I'm not looking down for long periods of time. It does the job well and it's a great addition to my desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  It was difficult to assemble, even though it is only connecting the parts together, the pieces were difficult to fit. it made metal scratching sounds and I had to push it really hard against a table.6 inch laptop.

Confused why there are so many high reviews.","positive":0},{"review":"  The little 'clips' feet that are meant to hold the base to the frame pop out so easily it took a half hour to get this to stay together, and even then I'm not exactly comfortable leaving my laptop sitting on it.  Definitely not good if you trust it to stay intact while you're working.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was excited to receive this laptop stand. It was very easy to put together, but after 8 days of use one of the screw covers on the bottom came off and now the pieces will no longer stay together. Laptop stand is now unstable and unable to be used.","positive":0},{"review":"  Can't open my laptop to a normal position without it falling over backwards. I ended up not being able to use it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is good, but there is a stain on it. I tried different ways to remove it. None of them worked.","positive":0},{"review":"  Meh. Not the best alloy used. A tad pricey for so so materialsGood for a workbench to keep the computer off dirty workbench.For daily use, metal is very cheap.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this in conjunction with a new monitor stand.  I wish I bought this weeks ago.  There is space below to store the keyboard so its out of the way when not in use.  If you buy one of these and do not have a keyboard I would suggest buy one as it is difficult to type on the laptop in this configuration.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a 15\" HP Laptop that fits perfectly on this stand.  The stand itself came nicely packaged and was very easy to assemble - took less than 30 seconds.There are nice pads on the arms of the stand so it doesn't scratch the bottom of the laptop.Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product was easy to put together and made an immediate difference in the placement of my laptop to ease the strain on my neck. I have a Dell from work and we are all at home now, so I've been trying to adapt my home workspace to make things more ergonomic. I also use this laptop stand when sitting, specifically when video conferencing. It helps to raise the monitor up so I look better on camera (we're all human).","positive":1},{"review":"  Very impressed with the fit and finish of the two that I bought for my kids.  I like it so much that I am getting one more for myself.  The Soundance ones turned out better than the Nulaxy version also sold on Amazon. Supposedly the same product, but the ones I got from Soundance had better fit-and-finish, and do not have the gigantic logo on the front cross-bar.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this because I prefer to use a larger keyboard sometimes instead of the one on my laptop. I also like to use a wireless mouse instead of the trackpad. Very easy to assemble, probably took me less than a minute once I glanced at the instructions. So far, it's really sturdy as well, no problems.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is sturdy, easy to put together and beautiful in use. Now my laptop can breath (vent on bottom) and my neck won't suffer because the stand moves the screen to almost eye level. Great product. Never been more please with an online purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought two of these stands. My work computer is smaller than my personal computer & the stand is a perfect size for that computer. It`s a good height ergonomically & has saved my neck that past month for sure. Just be aware if you have a larger laptop & it`s not against a wall.","positive":1},{"review":"  Needed a new stand for my Macbook Pro with all the work from home time. This did the job, and was well priced. The pictures I posted are with a 13\" Macbook Pro, for reference. I also appreciate the two small holes for wire management.","positive":1},{"review":"  Since we will be working from home, I was looking for an affordable, effective method of managing my desk space.  This is a very simple stand, easy to assemble, and sturdy.  I now have my work laptop up creating space under it.  The stand also brings the laptop up to a level for sight line so I am not looking down at it versus the large monitor on my desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love the silver chrome matte finish. It's sturdy, didn't have any scuff marks due to secure packaging, and the color matches my HP Pavillion convertible laptop well : )Although not adjustable, I find that the height of my laptop when placed on the stand is at a comfortable, natural eye level. Also there is enough room for a wireless keyboard underneath to type on.","positive":1},{"review":"  Digs into wrists.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is very good and does its job but the photo of product is deceiving. It doesn`t have anything  to hold the computer in the front. So it`s not very sturdy. Won`t recommend if you have little ones that numb into you or like to touch.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was unable to use the magic mouse when my macbook pro was on this stand. Worked fine when I removed the stand.","positive":0},{"review":"  Didnt stay together. The click doesn`t hold right. Had to super glue it. Ugh.","positive":0},{"review":"  The components of this stand are sturdy.  Its when they are put together that the stability is compromised.  The pieces just don't join together well and causes movement every time the computer is touched.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was quite excited to use this stand but I've been disappointed. The assembly was easy but the product itself is defective. I will be returning this right away. I guess you get what you pay for, I'll explore other expensive products in the space.","positive":0},{"review":"  The box it arrived in was falling apart. Deep scratch in the base, right where you can see it. Otherwise, it works.","positive":0},{"review":"  As you can see in the attached photos, the unit arrived with mismatched angles. This renders the stand relatively useless, given that the laptop does not rest flat.Since the unit is defective, I have to give it 1 star.","positive":0},{"review":"  Easy to assemble, looks nice, but doesn't work well for my macbook 16 inch. It broke too quickly.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great product had to return due to it being bent so far out norm can't use it. Returning item.","positive":0},{"review":"  I did my research and it paid off. Just started WFH and needed something for my relatively thick lenova laptop. Delivered quickly in four days but the box was covered in grease and split open. I sprayed with disinfectant before using.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand is exactly what I had been searching for. I have a laptop and beneath it another keyboard. This one is not only strong and is the perfect height, but also has space underneath for my glasses, little pads of paper, and other stuff. I am very pleased with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Perfect for meThere are three simple steps to put it together. I was up and running less than a minute. And the pain in my neck from looking downward at the display is gone.Great price too.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop stand has no problem holding up my beastly work laptop. It is sturdy and well constructed and feels very secure holding my laptop at a 35 or 40-ish degree angle about 5 inches up from the desk surface (from the front edge). It is nice to have the laptop up from the desk service because it provides a little more desk service space storage.I like it so much that I bought one for my husband.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was apprehensive about buying this for $30 bucks in the beginning but since I will be working from home for the unforeseeable future, I decided to buy this to make my home office more ergonomic. And I do not regret buying this. I love how there is space for my mac to air out and you are also able to put some notebooks and paperwork on the bottom. Would recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  First,  I want to say I am so impressed with this stand. After reviewing the reviews, I decided to get it for my new 15. The material is heavy but light enough to move from to room. I would highly recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a minor issue with evenness out of the box. One side was lower than the other. They elevate my fear of spilling water in my desk and it reaching my laptops. And the laptops vent more easily and stay cooler up on these stands.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was a game changer and allowed me to have two monitors at home. I thought working from home was going to be a hard set up but with this addition, it was a piece of cake and made me feel like I was right back in the office. I'm so pleased. Would for sure buy it again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was initially impressed with how sturdy this frame is. It was super easy to put together and feels very high quality. While it sort of fits it hangs off about two inches and seems a little unstable on the stand. I probably Should have looked around for a larger one.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently purchased this for my at-home business as I'm starting to do teleconferences more often with clients via my MacBook. This item allows me to use my laptop as more of a desktop now, which has been better for my neck and body posture. If you're considering this item, get it. You'll love it as much as I do.","positive":1},{"review":"  Of the 3 parts that exist for this stand 2 of them do not line up.","positive":0},{"review":"  It was advertised for a 15 inch computer but once u use it u realize that it`s super easily tippable.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product comes in three pieces. the base has rubber pads that are glued on to connect the stand which supports the laptop. The rubbers pads came loose. Reached out to the seller but have not heard back from them.","positive":0},{"review":"  The stand wobbles when typing.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is fine, but it arrived without any brand packaging and disassembled in an Amazon box with no padding between the metal pieces. When I first opened the box, honestly had no idea what I was looking af. The product looks lightly used, which is *not* what I ordered. Fortunately, I only need this to be functional for online teaching this year, so I will just keep it.","positive":0},{"review":"  You have to put this project together and it doesn`t fit properly or at least mine didn`t.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is to small, so that it will not sit flat, when laptop is on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  The basic idea is good for this stand. I should have bought one that`s adjustable though.  It helps my posture and neck but I`m awkward when typing because it`s so high.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I got this laptop stand, the way that one of the metal inserts was cut was cut really crookedly and I was not able to assemble it. I had to return it. I was able to get the left side assembled, but not the right. Then, when I tried to disassemble it so that I could put it back in the box, I couldn't do that either.","positive":0},{"review":"  My  laptop did not sit good on this but it is a nice atand.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop stand is the perfect height for video zoom conferences.  The camera is at eye level and is not looking up at the bottom of your chin.  We bought two of them and we still have to negotiate who in the family gets to use them from time to time.  I highly recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  i have been looking for something like this to rid myself of constant neck shoulder aches from my current setup with laptop flat on my desk.  this is sturdy, attractive, simple to set up and beats piling up books.  it is the right height and even gives you storage space below to clean up a messy desk littered with stray papers.  it works perfectly with my separate keyboard of choice.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm not sure if it's just a single product flaw that I happened to receive, but the bottom piece that connects and holds the two vertical pieces are not perfectly flush. There's a tiny edge that sticks out on one of the pieces. Because of how it's higher up on my desk, it gives more space to arrange things and have less clutter. Having my laptop eye leveled has definitely been great.","positive":1},{"review":"  My review echoes mm`s review except mine arrived a day early.  This is one of those Dream Amazon Purchases.  I ordered the black (matte) which shows off my new HP Spectre like a thing of beauty.  I`m a happy camper.","positive":1},{"review":"  Clips together in a few seconds. It doesn't require screws but it is still very sturdy. Fits my 14 inch and 13 inch laptops perfectly with 0 chance of either falling off. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and it is much cheaper than the competition.","positive":1},{"review":"  Liked it so much, I bought another to use at work.  It gets my laptop's display in line with my other screens and gives me a mice place to put kb mouse when not in use and I need desk space back. Super handy if you need to use a laptop in a stationary location.  The kids can put it on the coffee table and use machines while standing too.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand is great as it raises my laptop up higher, allowing for more ventilation, but it also helps with posture when sitting up. The only downside is the little ledges in the front that keep your computer from sliding off are higher than the base of my laptop, and when I have my arms in the same place for a while, for example typing, the ledges of the stand tend to dig into my wrists. (For reference, I use a 2020 MacBook Pro 13 in.) But other than that, I love it and almost always use this stand when I am at a desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, this is a great stand, it just doesn't have the best finish. I assembled the stand in less than 10 secs and it holds my 15\" Macbook perfectly. For me, ultimately it came down to that and I spent a little more to get something that better matched the finish of the Macbook. If the finish doesn't bother you, then this is a great buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great stand, holds my 15\" laptop nice and sturdy.  Better then I thought it would be. The keyboard clears the bottom legs, so I can have the monitor as close as I need it. Saves not having to use an external monitor.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been using the Griffin version of this since, hmmm 2002 and the limitation of that brand and design was there was a thick acrylic base in front so I wasn't able to slide in my keyboard and mixer.This, on the other hand, solved that concern plus the design is much more modern and you can select the color for you to match your computer. It is very sturdy and I know that this will last forever (Aluminum light and strong).In fact, I will order my second one after writing this review.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like the height the product provides, however, your wrists rest on the tabs that the computer sits in and its very uncomfortable.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a VERY cheaply manufactured stand. The arms on the one I received don't even match up so it just barley holds a laptop. Would never buy this again.","positive":0},{"review":"  NOT GOOD.","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved it when I first saw it. However, it is NOT sturdy. When I type, my laptop shakes because the two pieces holding it up are flimsy. It is past my return time and I am bummed about my purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  Will tip over with a bigger laptop. You need to lean it against something so your laptop doesn't fit.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love this stand because it was very easy to put together.","positive":0},{"review":"  I loved the product for the first 2-3 days - then, after I bumped into it, the legs got knocked off.  Normally, this would be fine except putting it back together, the legs didn't hold steadily again..stay tuned for the second try.","positive":0},{"review":"  One of the black pieces on the bottom snapped off right away, the pieces didn`t stay together. I`m returning and getting a refund.","positive":0},{"review":"  One side is longer than the other.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had to return, too high for my likeing.  Looks good, assembles easily.  Wish they made different heights.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very good, solid, with just a hint of flex (in a good way).  It looks like this was carved out of one piece of metal.  It`s a minor irritation, but I notice it after typing for a while.  Other than that, great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  \u00a0I can`t begin to express how amazing this product is. I have a very small workflow area as you can see from the images. I truly recommend this laptop stand for those in a budget and professionals the same. Very sturdy and I trust my $3000 laptop on it.","positive":1},{"review":"  My husband has a rain design laptop stand that I loved, but couldn't bring myself to spend as much as it costs. I ordered this stand during a flash sale, and I am over the moon. For me, the mark doesn't impact the functionality. Sturdy, packs well for travel, and ergonomic.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'd been looking for something to hold my 15 inch Mac Book Pro. I purchased another stand from a different vendor a month ago and needless to say, it didn't hold up.and it doesn't topple over like the other one did. Great price, great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This looks great as a placement for the laptop and does the job of keeping it in place off the table. But do not try to type on the laptop while it's on this stand because it is not sturdy enough for heavy hands typing and resting on it. I tried it and it wiggles up and down I was afraid it would snap in two. I recommend using a wireless keyboard with this stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  Before I purchased my 24\" monitor, I was using my 17\" laptop with a keyboard.  This stand elevated my laptop screen and made it easier to see.  A very inexpensive solution that looks aesthetically pleasing as well.  I bought a second one to give to my husband.","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn`t realize how much of a difference this made really until I was moving rooms and forgot it. My wrists were killing me. I use it for both my Mac and my PC. Great for Carpal Tunnel and prevents you from hunching.","positive":1},{"review":"  Easy to assemble and way sturdier than I thought. I work from home so this is perfect to keep my laptop at an even height with my second monitor. Previously, I`d been using a box and then a small shelf for years now to hold my laptop. Wish I`d had this before now.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall I like this. I bought it for zoom meetings so the camera on my laptop can be at a better angle. It was easy to assemble though, literally just 3 pieces that slide into place. Good for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very chic and minimalistic. Creates an even block of space on your desk allowing you to move an external keypad in front of you or stored under space. Your neck is aligned and straight and overall I`m just very pleased with it. It`s worth the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  The stand digs into your wrist when typing, you have to make a type of cushion.","positive":0},{"review":"  Look for a better stand the only reason why it has 2 stars instead 1 is that is extremely cheap.","positive":0},{"review":"  I prefer the rain laptop stand.","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased product from Amazon warehouse and it was missing the piece the ties the side peices together. I still use the product for my laptop to sit on to be used as my second monitor at my work station.","positive":0},{"review":"  The worst ever . I should have read the reviews .","positive":0},{"review":"  Great pedestal and perfect height.  Unfortunately the left side fell apart after 8 months of just using at home.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very disappointed in this product. It was sent to me incomplete. What a pain. I wish you luck getting your stand with the two pieces included.","positive":0},{"review":"  The arms are wildly unequal, by almost two inches. The stand is otherwise fine. I guess I just got a faulty stand as my unit.","positive":0},{"review":"  My daughter wanted this so much and loved it until it broke within 10 days of her receiving it and opening the box.  So disappointing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Has less than two months and the left side broke off, I tried emailing the company to see if I can receive a new one through warranty and the email isn`t even working. Definitely wouldn`t recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great for bringing your laptop up a little higher on your desk.  Easy to use and helps keep the unit cool.  It is sturdy, don`t get me wrong, you just need to be mindful of the weight distribution when using it.  I am happy with the purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a good product but when you rest your wrists on the bottom of the laptop, the edges that hold it on the stand cut into your wrists and it is not comfortable. You can put a towel or blanket to cushion it though. If you are not using it on your lap or you don't rest your wrists when you type, you will be fine. Great product otherwise.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been using my dining table as a wfh solution however my neck has been paying the price for being hunched over. I am using this to raise my laptop itself since I don't have a secondary monitor. The bottom also serves as a good place to store the keyboard mouse notebook when the machine is not in use. Worthwhile investment since I will be wfh for the considerable future.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased the stand to use for online teaching. It elevates my webcam to a nice height and keeps my laptop from getting too hot. However, for the minimal typing I do it`s perfect. I find it plenty sturdy and like that I can slide teaching aids underneath it for easy access during my classes.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been looking for months for some sort of stand to lift my MacBook Air above the desk, so that a dvd drive and two external hard drives could fit beneath it, and also have room to stow an external wired keyboard when using my iMac. Tried an inverted mesh letter tray, and it worked, but was in danger of sliding off the edge of the desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  First the positives:- Looks great, sturdy design (it's going to last.), easy to take apart and put together. The whole point of a laptop stand is to raise it up to an ergonomic height. I find myself putting it on a couple books or a box.","positive":1},{"review":"  Exactly what I was looking for. After researching and reading reviews, I decided on this design. I use my dining table for my work station, and this raises my laptop to eye level (I'm 5'7). Definitely worth the buy.","positive":1},{"review":"  i love it.  you can store books underneath.  it's a much better height.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this stand.. Would also work to elevate choir laptop screen next to another monitor if you prefer to use two monitors. Can`t say enough good things about this.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased for work laptop (Dell Latitude 5490) since WFH due to COVID. Quick assembly and sturdy for any keystrokes touchpad use on laptop when needed necessary. Increases built-in webcam level which is nicer for the many Zoom Skype calls that occur.

But disappointed that the material looks pretty cheap.. Not what I expected for the price paid.","positive":0},{"review":"  Like the product, besides the fact that its very wobbly because a piece fell out when i was sliding the bar in... I guess you get what you pay for.","positive":0},{"review":"  I do not like the fact that this item fell apart in less than two months. And item was used for what it is supposed to be used for, laptop stand.","positive":0},{"review":"  The two \"handles\" that you assemble into the base are crooked. The right one is longer than the other. Therefore your laptop will be slanted crooked when placed on the stand. Not the best design and poorly made.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unfortunately, the fastener on one side (keeps the stand together), has fallen off.  I've tried gluing it back on with no success.  Picture uploaded for clarification.","positive":0},{"review":"  This stand is good if you don't type a lot, but I do and my arms get extremely tired. Wish it had a setting to tilt the keyboard down towards you. I returned.","positive":0},{"review":"  price is now lower than what i paid during the 'prime day sale'.","positive":0},{"review":"  The stand works but I dropped it once, only a foot above the ground onto carpet and it broke from that. It can still work as a stand, but the legs pop off and won`t lock in place.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was reading the reviews when I bought this and they said 1) it wasn't good to type on and 2) it wouldn't work for Mac Books Laptops bigger than 15 or so inches. I have a 16 inch MacBook Pro and it fits and hold on this well. Also I can type on it just fine, I just wouldn't recommend typing a whole essay on it. Love it so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  Recently purchased this for helping release thr neck pain since starting do more online meeting at home. This item allows me to use my laptop on the\u00a0 desk and\u00a0 better for my neck. Came packaged well, assembly is easy, and is solid enough for my 17 inch laptop. I am be able to set longer and no more lower my neck for looking the screen.","positive":1},{"review":"  It comes in three parts, but it takes seconds to fit them together. It adds another thing to dust, but my desk is much neater now that I can slide my Bluetooth keyboard, mouse and number keypad under the stand. And I love the rose gold (I seem to be the only reviewer who got that color).","positive":1},{"review":"  This thang is perfect for my WFH rig that I`ve evolved ..(2) Better cooling air flow with vents raised up.(3) Nice space for more paper storage  organizing under it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to elevate my MacBook Pro to the same level as the bottom edge of a 24 LG Apple 4K monitor. I use the monitor as a second screen so this places my MacBook screen right next to the bottom edge of the monitor. I use a Logitech solar wireless keyboard to round out the setup.","positive":1},{"review":"  I researched quite a few laptop stands before buying this one, as now that I am working from home, looking down and typing on a laptop all day was wearing on my body. It is not very ergonomic. I have used it without the wireless keyboard and it is very sturdy. I am very happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  The product is easy to assemble and it give a sleek apperance. It also help with my neck pain. However, after a while, the attachment seem easy to detach when you moving your product. I hope it also has a back support for the computer to prevent it from falling.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wanted to lift my laptop off of my desk and this has turned out to be the perfect solution.  Lovely modern design and very sturdy.  I was able to assemble in less than two minutes.  I use a plug-in keyboard with my laptop and the design of this stand allows me to tuck the keyboard underneath the laptop when not in use.","positive":1},{"review":"  The arms right out of the box are bent at different angles. Took a while of bending unbending the arms to try to get them to be as close to possible but they're still a little off. Still usable though, my laptop just sits on it slightly not even (as in one side is a little higher). This fits my 17\" laptop even though description says it won't but my laptop is also very thin so not that heavy.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best product to have if you`re a student or simply want a way to de-clutter your desk space. I have two monitors and my laptop that I use for school. Using this has helped my desk so much and also my neck from having to look down and then up to my desk monitors. This also provides great storage underneath for any notepads or tablets.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product was delivered late and came damaged with a chip on two of the parts.

My laptop sits on it just fine but there is a very obvious wiggle if you type anything on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I did not realize that this stand would not work with my surface. Had to give it to my daughter who has a regular laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broke Upon Arrival. Would like refund or replacement.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this for better positioning of my laptop, and it does the trick. This would have five stars if the two \"lips\" positioned at the front didn't significantly hurt my wrists when I type on the keyboard. If you 100% use your mouse, you're good. I use this daily with my MacBook Pro 2018, annoying lip and all.","positive":1},{"review":"  I feel comfortable resting my laptop in this stand thanks to its patches of rubber (I think it is rubber). It helps keep my laptop in place while using it. Overall, I recommend this for people who want a raised laptop. It also helps for 2-in-1 because it slightly slants down, so you can draw more easily with the laptop raised and in tablet mode.","positive":1},{"review":"  Really impressed with this functional and aesthetically pleasing item even though I didn`t like the price.

Quickly shipped.I'm a satisfied customer.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great for aesthetics and cooling. I`ve got more room on my desk, better sight lines, and I`m hearing my cooling fan less. Holds my HP 840 G6 AND slim dock perfectly. I`m very happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love that I can put papers books binders underneath my laptop for easy-access while I'm working. This has been so, so great. I have a Macbook Pro 13\" and it fits my laptop great. I think it would work well with a 15\", but I'm not sure about laptops larger than that.","positive":1},{"review":"  A classmate suggested this to me and I'm so glad she did.

I love it and I highly recommend anyone working from home that is using a laptop to please consider purchasing this.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was going to get something from Rain Design since that's what everyone seems to use.

It fits together fairly snugly (was hard to take apart again), but if you plan on taking it apart a lot this is probably not the unit for you as I would expect it to fail fairly quickly in those instances.  It uses a bit of a strange mechanism that relies on a small plastic bit to hold things together.

Checking it out, i found that my computer didn't have just the 512GB SSD, but also had a 1TB HDD installed too--which coincides with what the Raider 9SE specs says.My only complaint is that the laptop has entered a hibernation mode a few times (4 times if i remember correctly) but i have sleep and screen blackout options both on never, the computer certainly wasn't too hot, and i didn't have anything magnetic near the corners that could trigger it into thinking i closed it.Once I get that solved, I think everything will be fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just got this laptop today runs most demanding games at 100fps+..

When I took it out of the box the first thing I noticed was that the factory seal was broken.

I feel like I may have been ripped off.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer was great & exactly what I wanted for about two months, but now every time I try to use it, it's almost guaranteed to go into hibernate mode randomly.

Probably not for those with ADHD, but for me it doesn't distract from the general experience I have with this laptop.

After I spoke with an Acer support person trying to figure out how to simply lock the function key just to find out it is physically impossible for this model, this person started to push other products on me because I expressed how dumb it was that this laptop didn't have such a basic feature.All in all, for a ~$500 i5 13in laptop, I would recommend this to anyone who could put up with those two issues, because literally everything else about this laptop is just great.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bough this renewed laptop for business and leisure purposes.

It's marketed as a gaming computer, but as an i5 may be a bit behind the times.  I bought it for business and photo editing for which needs it is more than adequate.

Folks will not be disappointed with this seller.","positive":1},{"review":"  Amazingly exceeded my expectations..Thanks for the top quality. I never write reviews but for you I have because I am very impressed.","positive":1},{"review":"  Okay so I have purchased four Dell laptops and know them very well, so I was not disappointed this time either.  I always purchase SSD for my laptops, and this one had it installed already.  What a deal at only $289.  Worked out of the box, and I expect 2 to 3 years of service like my other Dells.","positive":1},{"review":"  My wife was using a ten year old laptop that had very dated components.  I bought the Dell e6430s from Blazing Prices because my last place of business used this model and  I couldn`t stand my wife`s crying from the next room. I will probably swap it out with something larger.My wife adds that she really loves this machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop I received is truly in like new condition.  I`m so glad I took a chance on this deal.  Thanks to the seller for this great deal (Sold by: Laptop Experience )..","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop with low expectations.  My experience with refurbished laptops had been negative.  This Dell laptop is now my go to computer.  Will go with TekRefurbs from now on.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a similar computer (not Dell) that died finally and I bought another notebook brand. It was okay, but it died fast.This one is like my other computer - very sturdy - love the keyboard.  Also LOVE Windows 10.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop works perfectly and was an outstanding value.  I have my own computer business, Moxley Computers, LLC, and I couldn't have built such a nice laptop for the price I paid.  No driver issues and it was on the latest version of Windows 10 which was just recently released.  Awesome Purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have purchased refurbished products from Skytech a few times. I have never been disappointed. Great customer service. If you don't use them, remember I warned you.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very nice laptop.  Works perfectly.  Purchasing a renewed computer is sort of a roll of the dice (reviews certainly being helpful), however, of the five that I have purchased over the years the noted HP is the only one that I have found disappointing.  I gave the noted HP Elitebook 840 G to my local high school computer lab for them to make use of, experiment with or part out.","positive":1},{"review":"  The left button just stopped working. It is definitely a hardware issue with the touchpad- it doesn't work even in the BIOS setup- so it isn't a software issue. The quality of their work is poor- but I would have let that slide if Skytech LLC USA would have just sent me a replacement for the defective part instead of expecting me to be without a laptop for a month. Unacceptable Skytech LLC USA.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am in the process of returning the first unit and will update this if the  2nd works properly but this unit starts then shuts down and the re-booting process is a nightmare (not even sure why I tried, but I thought maybe I could fix it so I gave it a shot).  I get the \"Invalid Partition Table\" error and to even get it to start again for a few minutes it needs to boot from a USB drive.  I've had good experiences with Dell refurbished units, but this one is not good.  Hopefully its the exception.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've been trying to turn off airplane mode and turn on wifi all morning. It's a very strange thing--you drag the wifi button in settings from \"off\" to \"on. If someone would like to troubleshoot this with me over email and it gets fixed, I'll change my review. Otherwise I'm sending it back and will expect a full refund.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop is pretty fast due to its processor, SSD, and Ram. I'm not really sure if you can do much better for the price. Anyways, I ended up just buying a new laptop out of fear that other parts would fail due to a lack of cooling. Hope this helps someone.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product arrived quickly and in good condition, as described, but is useless as a \"laptop\" due to battery life. If not plugged in, the system shuts down in less than an hour. (Tasks are email, Google Drive, and internet searches.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this renewed laptop for online college courses. I was really let down.Bottom line, watch out. Buy new if you're looking for a ready-to-go device that doesn't need additional set-up before using.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased a dell laptop, they sent me a Lenovo.  Not sure if I will return it or not.  Makes me leery of the competence of the seller re-builder.","positive":0},{"review":"  Impossible to connect with anything.  Wireless connections not connecting.  As an aside the delivery note said placed on the front porch..","positive":0},{"review":"  Computer is fine but instead of a headphone jack there's a headset logo with a yellow led. Disappointed. I'd rather have a headphone jack.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not work on start up went to to repair several times, and kind of ruined the face it was a present. I do tech support, and it's not that hard to press a button and see if the unit starts, if you are a tech I would fire you. Since YOU CAN NOT EVEN START UNIT TO SEE IT WORKS OR NOT.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this refurbished Windows 10 laptop to do my taxes.  The 2019 TurboTax  didn't work on my Window 7 desk top. Back to work.  Blame the operator.","positive":1},{"review":"  My wife loves her new Dell. We've had several Dell laptops over the years and except for the one we had loaded with Vista they have all been good.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got furloughed with uncertain prospects of getting my job back at the end of it so needed a super basic machine so that I could still do the basics -- check on unemployment, look for jobs, email, maybe console myself with Stardew Valley .. Booted up right away and so far has worked great. Looks as shiny and clean as if it were brand new.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this Dell Latitude refurbished laptop because I just needed the basic laptop for email and surfing the Internet. I was very pleased with the cleanliness of the laptop. The laptop is very fast and it does everything I wanted it to and more. If you`re looking for a laptop to use for regular, everyday use, then this is a great product for the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  To be honest, I was reluctant to purchase a reconditioned laptop not knowing how the machine had been handled by the prior owner. After several visits to the site, considering what I thought I would be doing and what I could afford, I settled on this model. along with careful notes from this supplier regarding system activation, the newly installed Windows 10 software, and a reassuring note that if any issues arise, to contact them first. So far I'm very satisfied, and have experienced no problems at all with this laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  The shipping was fast, and the laptop looks good.  A few dings in the the top cover, but the keyboard looks and feels new.  No big deal, the laptop is working fine, and I am happy with it.I would recommend this product, and this seller.","positive":1},{"review":"  After 4 months I'm still very happy with this refurbished Dell, it's solid, feels indestructible but sits comfortably on the lap.  It's fast starting up and moves easily from screen to screen. I almost returned it but decided to buy a Doss bluetooth speaker instead.  Glad I did.","positive":1},{"review":"  was a little put back to find out this laptop is about 5 years old with an update that had windows 10 pro installed,  but it does seem to be working up to my standards so far, seems very fast and it does. look brand new. would have also liked to have had some kind of owners manual.  only have had it it a day but I'd say over all I'm satisfied.","positive":1},{"review":"  Laptop works perfectly. True to the specs as advertised but NO backlit keyboard which I really wanted. Battery life is an excellent 7 hrs with the extended size battery. So I guess my only complaint is no backlit kb and for $207 its not a deal breaker.","positive":1},{"review":"  I honestly could not tell this laptop was not brand new. As an experienced IT Security Pro I expected minor cosmetic marks and wear, some minor dust or use marks on the keyboard, etc but found nothing whatsoever to indicate prior usage.This is not the first choice I`d recommend for a gamer or for a heavy usage laptop but for our purposes involving light usage it performs remarkably thanks to the SSD hard drive, adequate RAM and a lean Windows 10 OS without a boatload of bloatware.  Great value for the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop looks great, but the hard drive and RAM aren't as specified. I received 4GB of RAM instead of 8GB and a standard 500 GB hard drive instead of the 128GB SSD. However, Debian 10 runs just fine on it so far. The main problem I had was installing the wireless adapter firmware.","positive":0},{"review":"  There are so many irritations with this laptop. Despite getting a replacement battery, it will die immediately at random when not plugged in. Everywhere I look, there's something not right. I'm not buying from this seller again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Computers all right but when I received at the battery was no good and I can't afford another $50 for a battery and I think when you order something and receive it everything should be in working order at least for the when you get it.","positive":0},{"review":"  After using the computer intermittently for a month, the computer fan has failed making it almost impossible to run anything that requires the smallest amount of processing. I am weary of dells but this all but confirms my suspicions of dells.

Was so satified bought a second one for my wife.","positive":1},{"review":"  This company was kind enough to supply a new cord to charge the battery, and it arrived before the laptop. The enclosed note said the original didn't meet their standards, so that was a nice touch. The laptop itself has performed as required, and I have had zero issues with it. I wouldn't hesitate to order from them again.","positive":1},{"review":"  My laptop arrived and it was a little smaller than I would have preferred. I contacted the seller and spoke with Stefan. My new laptop arrived in excellent condition and is the perfect size. I would recommend this company if you are looking for a great laptop at an affordable price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought as a gift, worked out of the box and no issues with the copy of windows working. It was very clean and looked new. Fits all the specs for anyone wanting something that can do medium level tasks but doesn't need Photoshop etc. Good price for value.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for work and when my daughter needs to do school work.  Only thing I did not like was the office 365 because of how much it costs to activate it.  Other than that it was worth the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was hesitant about buying a laptop online at first but I had a horrible experience with Best Buy and decided that it couldn't get much worse.

The only reason I make it 4 star is that it's heavier than newer models and may have less storage space. I installed Ubuntu to make it a dual boot machine.

As for the Chromebook, Dell has, in my opinion, always made quality products. I am hoping that they get more of these.I am very happy with this.","positive":1},{"review":"  For this to be refurbished, this chromebook works great. I truly thought this was a brand new laptop. Amazon customer service works great with you in solving any issues you may have. So go and give this a try, I'm sure you will enjoy this chromebook as I am right now.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this Chromebook to use a Linux laptop. That is, if it looks and works okay, I am going to remove Chromeos and install Linux.  Given the price tag, this was a pretty good deal: a used computer in nice physical condition and good enough performance at about half the cost of the new equivalent.This is the fifth or six refurbished computer I have purchased and, as usual, paying attention to the seller feedback, in choosing a vendor seems to increase my chances of getting a good deal.","positive":1},{"review":"  As a prolific writer that uses Google Docs for almost everything, this is a real deal and a treat. It's the perfect size and weight to carry around. As an alternative to more expensive items like large screen phones or tablets, this is ideal.

They need to use laptops now for homework and use Chromebook at School so they are familiar with them. Good for me as I am no longer needed for tech support. Either for my kids or my parents.","positive":1},{"review":"  Okay so I'm a Windows 7 user, and had been scared to get a Chromebook for years, because I didn't think that it would do certain things I wanted to do, like play online golf and store files on it that I want to keep..Well as soon as you sign into your Gmail that's where everything is anyway and Google drive lets you store everything more than the hard drive space I had on my Acer laptop so I was wrong Chromebook is the way to go, you can do everything you need to do with it, I got the $80 refurbished one one small line in the computer screen itself other than that it seems like brand new and I use my TV for the monitor anyway which works flawlessly and I use a wireless mouse which works flawlessly, I got the one with 4 gigs of RAM which runs flash and movies flawlessly much better than my Acer laptop, so even a refurbished one seems perfect a new one is about a hundred and fifty bucks and I have heard some of the refurbished ones can be pretty bad anyway four stars on the main review because of the crack on the screen other than that five stars for everything else..","positive":1},{"review":"  I've read reviews about refurbished equipment, but this Chromebook was great.

It's possible that others may have had bad experiences but I did not. I will never go back to windows. Customer for LIFE.","positive":1},{"review":"  Wow amazing product for the price. I ordered 3 total for students at my college in need as a donation. Great buy for general college studies or writing. Not for gaming or photography.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed a lightweight laptop for traveling and chose this refurbished Dell Chromebook.  It arrived in 2 days and doesn't have a scratch on it.  Haven't tried Google Cloud document site yet but it looks easy to use and to my surprise had loaded many documents I've received from others that were written in Google Cloud.  Simply stated a perfect little machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  The lap top came with a \"manager\" installed on the machine, which I cannot delete or exchange it with.  This way the seller will have access to all my passwords and operations that I do...","positive":0},{"review":"  The device itself is in great working order - seems brand new, being that it's refurbished.  HOWEVER, this came to me kinda janky-looking.  I'm giving this to someone as a gift, and am a little embarrassed of the quality of it.  It seems to work fine (which, really, is all that matters) but I'm very disappointed in the physical appearance of the product.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was purchased as a Christmas gift and was opened by the recipient on December 24.  I received a call last evening that the Chromebook will not turn on any more.  This is after being used just a day over two weeks.  I am extremely disappointed in this purchase and must now look into returning it for a refund.","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing is a piece of crap. Slow, Janky, just what you would expect from Google and Dell. This useless waste of money doesn't even run appstore - the fact I was able to hack Linux onto it is the only reason it never went into the trash can and even at that its sitting on a shelf ever since due to the fact that a tortoise covered in molasses in January is faster than this overpriced piece of trash.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just unboxed and havent had time to test everything but I wasn't too thrilled with the lack of padding in the box that it was shipped in.The metal in HDMI and USB ports are OXIDIZED RUSTED. The cursor jumps around erratically making it hard to click on things. These items belong on craigslist not Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  The device itself looks brand new, but we can`t download any apps. Have tried multiple times to download the google play app so we can download games for the kids, but  have been unsuccessful. The kids are already over it and don`t want to play with them.","positive":0},{"review":"  Had to send back twice because of operation issues. They are quick to ship out replacements but shouldn`t be having these issue. Product looks heavily used with Velcro on the bottom and some sort of weird coating or paint added.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is bad when you want to return that they will change you 43 fee. When you want to buy cheap laptop that you need take care. And they are screen super small. I hope you guys do not choose that  company.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product turned on, but my screen has issues. Looks like someone pressed down too hard on it. When I pay for a renewed or refurbished item, I don`t expect like new but I wouldn`t expect this issue with the screen either.","positive":0},{"review":"  Our daughter was excited to use this for her 1st day of college.  When we got it we turned it on and there as a white dot the size of a pencil head that showed up in the middle of the screen.  We notified the seller 5 days ago, 3 business days ago and they still have not responded.  so unfortunately had to file a claim with Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  My first adventure with Amazon Renewed, and I won't hesitate to go back.

For what I needed, it's perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  after I bought the Chromebook for half price, I found out that it was made in 2010, and the same month I bought it, the warranty expired.

They both love their chrome book and find it easy to navigate.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got a renewed Chromebook.  To look at it, you would think it was brand new.  I'm very pleased with it.  The only thing that I'm not 100% happy with is there is no touch screen, which I am use to having.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this Chromebook for my son, this is his first laptop and I wanted to get something that was durable, lightweight and is great with performance. So after 2 days of searching I came across this one and I was impressed how it met all of my expectations, including the price.  I highly recommend this for students and anyone looking for a lightweight, durable and affordable chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  I don`t really like the mouse pad on this laptop there`s no right click or way to copy and paste. The way the browser is set up to pop up and down with barely a touch is weird. I Guess I`ll need to figure out how to tweek it a bit but overall it`s a decent laptop for the price. It`s efficient for the basics of internet browsing and schoolwork which I often use it for.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very happy with this bargain. It looks very nice and has features I need. There is USB connection if you like to use a mouse externally.  The battery last long enough but I can't tell exactly as I use the Chromebook only occasionally.","positive":1},{"review":"  Christmas gifts for children to do homework.","positive":1},{"review":"  Had an issue but it was resolved most professionally and with great expediency. Would highly recommend Kiko for quality renewed products.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this as a Christmas gift. It came with scratches on the top and the bottom, but they weren`t too bad. When you open it, it pretty much looks brand new. I did purchase a cover that fits perfectly so that the scratches aren`t visible since they were only on the exterior of the device.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I received the first Dell Chromebook I was hugely impressed.  It did everything it was designed to do *****5star.  I just spent 2 hours trying to order prescription refills.  No luck so far.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've never been so disappointed with an Amazon purchase. I knew it was refurbished and bare bones, but I only wanted it for one reason.

Item apparently older so downloading Play Store and apps didn't seem to work properly.  Loved the size and its light weight.

My mistake.Worst Christmas present ever.Would not purchase again.","positive":0},{"review":"  First, this does not have a touch screen. It doesn't claim to. Also, I was able to support an all woman run company. Totally awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  Purchased this laptop for our son as a Christmas present.

Also, for a refurbished product, it looks and seems brand new.","positive":1},{"review":"  came in earlier then amazon said it would, not like-completely new, but mostly good on the referb part. it was a little dirty and the screen wasn't cleaned that well. the packaging though was pretty bad, I'm surprised that the screen is fine, let alone the computer. the box was beat up but everything was wrapped in bubble wrap.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this model refurbished.It arrived in excellent condition, factory reset, and ready to be used. The screen is sharp and crisp. I am very satisfied with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just purchased and so far, so good.

Love the speed of turning on the Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything was great when one moment it came of and never turned on again, the worse part is that i dont have a year with it. And i love this computer specially for me that writes and research alot, the battery life is amazing.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to replace a cheap new one that I bought at the beginning of the school year. I bought new because I thought my son would get more time out of it, but the build quality of that one was clearly inferior. It lasted less than one month past the warranty. At the price of this one if it lasts a year I won't feel bad, and because it's a chromebook and everything is online, the transition is easy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Perfect purchase. I have ordered 2 times from this vendor, both Chrome books are 100%. They look new and function appropriately. The kids can do their school work now , thank you for being who you said you are.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this Chromebook for work (I'm director of a nonprofit orgnaization in my state) and it works perfectly.

I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I used this right out of the box and have really done a lot with it. The battery charges quickly and last a long time. All in all a decent device. I would recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  If I could give zero stars I would. You get what you pay for. not even two months old and it will not charge or power on.

I bought the 2 year warranty, seller has NOT contacted me back.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought 32 of these for Christmas. I had to return 1 in February because it wouldnt turn on. Now 2 of the 3 are broke. They are refurbished and wont last long maybe a few months.","positive":0},{"review":"  Don't buy this is you want a laptop that is \"fixed\". This is supposed to be a \"renewed\" laptop, however, the laptop has a crack under the screen and I cannot see half of the screen. When I tried to return this laptop they were going to make me pay shipping which is ridiculously expensive so by the time I messaged them about that they said it was too late to return this laptop.

Buy knowing you'll at least get one that works.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had to return this item not based on anything wrong with this item. Just that I cant run windows or get any animation software to run on the platform.  But this item does run fast and it is great on security or securing your information once it's set up.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought in January. Used 4 times before some buttons stopped working.

Coming from a windows tablet, commands are a little different.","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn't know what to expect because I had never used Chromebook before. It's so easy to learn and this one works great. It's not a touchscreen but I'm ok with that.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like it a lot because it fits in my big purse. Also it's a dell and it's definitely the quality that I expected. Very reliable and for the money was a very good value. I definitely feel good about my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased two of these in November 2018 for my kids to use for school work.  Just under a year later the batteries have died.

Otherwise it seems to be working just fine so far.","positive":0},{"review":"  Complete garbage. Screen arrived broken and Amazon refused to return or refund for the broken Chromebook.

My only complaint is that it operates so differently than any PC I have used I had to watch hours of instructional videos to learn how to set them up.

This is the Acer Chromebook 14 released 2016 that was manufactured in 2017, with a beautiful screen, strong aluminum body, and a relatively weak processor compared to other Chromebooks. The model number, which is not included anywhere in the description, is CB3-341.  Do your research before you buy it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Exceptional value for money. I was actually down to plunge up to $600 on a Chromebook, but all the top models (Samsung Chromebook Pro, ASUS C302) have small screens (12. It's the complete opposite. Very happy with the purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  While this is my first Chromebook my wife has had one for a while and I've used hers extensively. We are preparing for a trip and my old Dell laptop is great but Its a brick. While this is a minor issue I would have preferred a keyboard surface that had a bit more texture. I have big hands and while I'm a touch typist the keyboard is a bit of change for me and will take some getting used to.","positive":1},{"review":"  Holy hell, I did not expect this great of a product by the price that I paid ($188) it came in a regular box but packaged safely inside a thick bubble mailer. Charging cord & Bluetooth mouse included. I`m actually contemplating buying another one for my mom. I hope they have a lot more in stock.","positive":1},{"review":"  The computer was very well packed and it included a wireless mouse, which was a nice touch. I like it for how easy it is to set up, and it boots in seconds. The metal body on this Chromebook makes it look like laptops that cost hundreds of dollars more. I'm sure it will be great for my job as a freelance writer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was a bit skeptical purchasing anything refurbished from Amazon. But this feels and performs like it's brand new. This is also my first Chromebook and I love it. Fast shipping, and also came with  a wireless mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a very nice device.  You will see many comments that it looks very high-end.I use this computer for anything where security is a concern.  I think we are more exposed to bad behavior from our merchants that someone actively hacking our devices, but I am convinced that the Chrome OS is much more secure than any version of Windows.","positive":1},{"review":"  As the father of a high school student and a heavy user in my home office I've been through a bunch of Chromebooks (I buy a new one for me and give him my previous one each time his current one breaks, which is frequently) and have found them to be uniformly cheap (in the wrong way), underperforming and poorly made, particularly the HP Chromebooks which are frankly pure garbage.  The Asus chromebooks are the best inexpensive ones I've found, at least they last longer than a few months, but they're still quite cheap feeling.So far, this is the only Chromebook I would heartily recommend to anyone.  Mine was refurbished and works flawlessly.","positive":1},{"review":"  My family has been using chromebooks for the last 3-4 years.  With one exception, all of those machines were bought as refurbished, and we've had no issues with with any of those chromebooks.  I like it so much, I'm going to upgrade and buy myself another one.  Refurbished, of course.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was a little skeptical buying a used computer for the first time. I am very happy that I did. I did not realize that it didn`t ship with a charger, so that was a little inconvenient and additional cost to consider. Aside from that this chromebook is fast and fun to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this Acer Chromebook in hopes of a lightweight little travel laptop. It had very good specs for a Chromebook, a nice screen, and I thought I'd give it a shot. Don't buy them. I will be returning this one for good, and will not replace it.","positive":0},{"review":"(August 2, 2018) First off, although I tried to research this as well as possible, there is no model number mentioned anywhere, thus no way to tell for sure what exactly one will receive. Would be advisable to ask the vendor for the full model number - and make sure you get the info. Also notable is that these units automaticall load drivers for Logitech Unifying USB dongle and I instantly had access to my laptops keyboard and mouse \u2014 this is a huge plus.More of the setup and operation (as well as longevity) later.","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing has so much promise, but it's all ruined by an inexplicably tiny power connector. There's no use reviewing the product when it cannot be charged. Thanks to the vendor for supplying a replacement power brick, but the socket in the Chromebook collapsed. It's a ridiculous design.","positive":0},{"review":"  It seems to be hit and miss on what kind of device people get from this. My device came powered on in the box just on sleep mode. Save yourself the hassle and just get a new one. This product will be returned.","positive":0},{"review":"  I owned ACER chromebook from back in summer 2014, was also refurbished, plastic, with very poor screen. But it worked perfectly, was so fast, and went through so much rough time being beaten in the backpack and I was working with it around small kids and preschoolers, so it was always sticky and kept being chunked at the end of day. It came with a nice lightweight white charger and a very nice slim mouse from ACER. But I wish it worked better.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought a refurbished model through Amazon for $209 in November 2018.  The chromebook worked as described. Nothing worked..","positive":0},{"review":"  Looks great, works great..UPDATE.  AFTER 6 Months Microphone stopped working and seller wont do anything.","positive":0},{"review":"  This Chromebook is not as good \"inside\" as the original  Acer C720, which could hold a huge number of tabs open while still working fast and never crashing, for years on end. This one has a much improved screen and case, which will make up for this with some users. But it happens, and turns this into a media-watching device more than a work tool. For watching movies or listening to music, it's just dandy.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received this Acer in Like-new condition.  There were no scratches or dings, and it came with a charger and mouse.  Looks like there are others with this problem.  Buyer beware.","positive":0},{"review":"  Only lasted a few months before the display stopped working  Third party seller  Trivalley Electronics  was dismissive when asked about a rebate.  If you are considering this chromebook, read all the reviews.  There are others reporting the same problem.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very happy with the purchase. It can handle tasks very well, I usually have a lot of tabs (10-20) open at a time and notice no lag. I do have a refurbished one, so maybe that's not the case for a brand new one.Overall, happy with the purchase, just a bit annoyed about the screen brightness and the battery life.","positive":1},{"review":"  Wow I honestly can't believe this laptop was so cheap. It looks brand new, no scratches or marks or anything. Both of my parents work from home and so they use their laptops constantly and have really expensive ones but after seeing mine they are switching over to this. If you have any doubts then get them out of your mind because this is the best laptop and you will never be able to beat the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great computer.  I've had this a month.  In other words, I'm a touch typist, and when I go to put my fingers on the keyboard, I find that I'm putting them in the wrong spot initially.  As I've used the keyboard more and more, this is less and less of a problem, as I adjust to where the keys actually are.","positive":1},{"review":"  I could not be more pleased with this laptop.The keyboard and screen are large so that I have room to type as well as view videos easily.It is thin and light, making it easier to transport.The battery life is awesome - lasting for at least 12 hours on continuous use.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just got this device:1.  Device came in a \"like new\" condition.  Haven't tested the audio yet, but I do not intend to watch many videos on this unit.All in all, for the price, I say this is a buy for anyone looking for a chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is just great.. Crazy light though, crazy good display, and with the aluminum frame crazy durable. It's just like the day I bought it and I've far exceeded my money's worth on it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a refurbished laptop and I was expecting some minor defects. In my case, one chassis corner shows some deformation, a very small damage. Acer is to me, the leader of the chromebooks (I still use my C720 Acer Chromebook).  This laptop was shipped to Mexico and it came with the best protection material.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very happy. Looks and works like brand new. Came with a wireless mouse, nice.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, the build quality is the best I've seen for any chromebook. It is all-aluminum, silent, and lightweight.As far as the refurbished aspect goes, I cannot tell, in any respect, that this machine isn't perfectly new.  There were absolutely no cosmetic blemishes, the charger is perfect, and performance is the same as a new machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  The mouse doesn't power up, I tried several batteries and tested them on other devices. It didn't come with piece that plugs into the USB. I will be returning. Completely unhappy.","positive":0},{"review":"  less than a year of owning it at the internal charging component is broken.. I did nothing funny with it, kept it in a case.  Went to put the charger in and something inside broke and it won't charge any longer.","positive":0},{"review":"  We have had this laptop for a week, and overall it seems to be good for what my husband needs it for, but the bluetooth won`t work. It keeps searching and doesn`t recognize the bluetooth speeaker to pair with it. I know the speaker works because I was able to pair it with my phone. So far that seems to be the only issue we have with it, but kind of a big issue because the speaker would add extra volume when we want it and added bass for playing music.","positive":0},{"review":"  Received my \"certified refurbished\" Chromebook today without a charging cable. Maybe it's a great buy. Maybe it's a piece I trash. I'll never know because I can't even turn it on and without a charging cable, I can't change that.","positive":0},{"review":"  This computer was not refurbished to a condition like new. Somebody had put Korean language stickers on the keyboard, and it looks like the refurbisher removed some, but left a bunch of stickum behind, while other stickers were still on the keyboard and looked like they had been picked at before somebody gave up. There were also a small spots of sticky gunk on the computer. Clearly the refurbisher, a third party called PlanITROI, does shoddy work, and I would recommend against purchasing from them.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this laptop for 5 months. It worked well without any problems until now. However, because I've had it for only 5 months, I am unable to send it back. I'm upset.","positive":0},{"review":"  Chromebook is super sleek works for what its purpose is.  It did not come with a charger nor wireless mouse as presumed.","positive":0},{"review":"  But it slide into the sink from the counter about 5 inches and screen broke making the computer unusable.  No water in the sink and it slide not fell.I replaced it with another Chrome book but I bought this one from Dell. It looks much more sturdy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good product. BUT I received it with a defect. it almost feels like they just checked to see if it turned on but didn't bother to actually inspect the problem. You might as well just spend the extra $70ish to get a new and working (hopefully) product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Im pretty disappointed with this chromebook. The router is 3' away, and it shows a weak signal. I can be across the room with any of my other devices with full wifi strength, so I know it is the chromebook, and not the wireless signal. Would not buy again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for my high school sophomore to use both at school and home.  Just starting to use it, but am very impressed with apparent build quality and screen size sharpness.  Bought it Prime one-day and got it within 8 hours of ordering even though it came from a facility over two hours away.  So far, so good.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had mine ten months now and I love it. It works like a dream and never lets me down. I have talked other people into buying this Acer model as well. It was so inexpensive that even if it died today I feel I've gotten my money out of it and I would buy another immediately.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Acer 14\" Chromebook is an easy and lightweight device for most of the things I do with a laptop.  I can keep it around the house where I normally sit down and quickly check my mail, look at a Youtube video, play some music, etc.  Even though it is repackaged, it appears to be brand-new.  The seller, iTech360, is top-notch.","positive":1},{"review":"  I try to only write reviews for things that aren't reviewed a bunch, this one fits that bill. I don't have a ton to say about it because it works absolutely perfect for me and the others have said most of the things I have dealt with. Frankly if that actually works, then I never have another need for a Windows or Linux computer ( I have preferred Linux.)Your needs may be very different than mine, I couldn't be happier with mine.","positive":1},{"review":"  Make sure you know what you are buying.  This is a Chromebook.  Battery life is very long. I didn't do anything that even challenged the battery.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this machine to be a simply task manager for basic computer functions, word editing, email, browsing etc. It does all of those things really well. If I get more than a few browser windows open, especially things like email and facebook which are constantly monitoring for updates, it really starts to lag and its limits become more apparent.Still, for the cost, simplicity, ease of use, its a great machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the price, you really can`t beat this product. There`s really not much to it, it does have a sturdy feel to it which is good. I`m sure with time it`ll get easier but now I`m spending a bunch of time researching how to convert documents. I guess that`s just the Google platform.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great \"laptop\". Its built like a tablet with a keyboard as far as the system goes. It took me forever to find out how to even do this. Overall I love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  So fast, so simple, so light. This is my first Chromebook, I bought it refurbished for an even better deal, and it has been fantastic. Maybe--there are certainly times when I would use it as a tablet if I had that option. The keyboard is nice (though I would have preferred caps lock instead of a search button), the touch pad is very good, but a touchscreen gives a more relaxed, intimate experience.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm a long time Mac user and still am, but I'm happy with this purchase. I bought the refurb so I had a cheap laptop to use and share with my son. I bought the Acer rebuilt refurb for $199. Totally worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Beautiful, crisp display but brightness flickered constantly - very annoying - tried a couple setting changes but they did not fix the problem. Also, wouldn't take a charge. Repackaged for return less than 2 hours after it was delivered. Not a like new or \"renewed\" product at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is a piece of crap. Supposed to be refurbished but it did not turn on for more than 1 sec. Do not ever buy anything refurbished if you don't want to loose your money. Which I lost $200.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bluetooth constantly disconnects with any device that it connect to..  Again bluetooth refuse to recognize the paired devices, has to perform Powerwash (factory reset) multiple time to get it going again. Disappointment.","positive":0},{"review":"  The appearance is nice. No scratches or dents. I wouldn't mind it so much if it only happened occasionally, but I'm estimating it's happening every 10-15 minutes more or less. If I can figure out how to solve the issue, I would have no complaints at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received laptop without charger an I need to refund of 20% of the Item price as per your mail.","positive":0},{"review":"  Refurbished Chromebook is nice but the mouse doesn't work and there is no manual. I called Acer Support and had to leave a message, but no reply. Will try again tomorrow.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop was decent, with good build quality and a good screen. The battery life was sufficient. However, this \"certified refurbished product\" has completely stopped working after only a couple months of use without any damage from the consumer.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is completely inaccurate. Keyboard is foreign and not listed correctly. The section around the screen is popping out.","positive":0},{"review":"  This Acer chromebook worked great, but just after the warranty, my daughter lifted open the screen pushed lightly on the actual screen instead of the frame on the top edge.  She felt a crack and the screen was ruined.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got these and two of them did not work and because they were a gift they were opened past the return window so we are stuck with broken gifts so disappointing to pay so much and they not work and the person I spoke to was like oh well past return time .","positive":0},{"review":"  First, this Chromebook has Play Store Android App support.  It's thin and sleek and has a solid metal feel.  Also, the CB15 has a larger screen which is my preference.Either one of these is a great browsing device, and I recommend both.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was just what the doctor ordered. My wife was tired of worrying about Windows security updates, poor battery life, long boot times, viruses, etc. She likes using it, and I like that she doesn't complain about her computer anymore. Win   win.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love my chromebook. It came in almost perfect condition there is a tiny scratch on the corner but not too noticeable. FYI the little USB wireless connector for the mouse is in the mouse. When you remove the top of the mouse to insert the battery you will see it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Been wanting a new laptop for some time now, but personally never felt i could justify the price tags of many of the standard laptops running windows or mac. When i came across the idea of Chromebooks it really just made sense on so many levels. I'm highly impressed considering the price tag. To anyone on the fence, you have my vote of confidence.","positive":1},{"review":"  I spilled a drink on my old Windows laptop and killed the trackpad.  I used it mostly for surfing and watching Netflix.  Can't believe it at this price point.  Glad I bought it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great, fast and secure 1080p Chromebook with a long-lasting battery. Chrome OS is arguably the most secure OS around due to its background auto-updates.Also, if you have a Chromecast or Nvidia Shield, this works really well with those.Regarding this hardware, the speakers are very average, the 1080p screen is a big improvement over the more common lower res Chromebook screens, and the SSD and fanless machine make this one very fast, very secure, very silent, very affordable laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my wife, who is used to the Chrome browser on an older Win7 laptop updated to Win10.  She mostly uses the browser (email, news, social media) and needs to download and view .  It looks new, the only signs that it is a refurb were that it was already charged and the power adapter came with rubber bands around the cords. Performance is snappy, it's very light and thin compared with her laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  My first foray into a Chromebook, after doing quite a bit of research first.  Cannot believe it boots up so quickly. less chance of viruses.  Very pleased with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought mine here from the seller \u2018certified-technology` I think. Great condition, I don`t see one scratch on it. I`m new to chrome books but it didn`t take very long at all to set it up, especially since I already had a gmail account. Hopefully it keeps working this great for a long time.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Chromebook I received was in new condition.  Not a single scratch or blemish.  Fortunately,  once acclimated, it does not get hot at all.So pleased to save over $100 compared to the exact same product at Costco.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sometimes freezes but seems a common Acer issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  The chromebook arrived in perfect condition but did not come with charger or cord which one would expect on such as purchase,  Returned for that reason,.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was dumb enough to buy three of these.  All were defective out of the box.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I hover over a link, it is unintentionally selected. very bad.","positive":0},{"review":"  A right side speaker is not working. The seller sent me still defective one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this chrome book in May and it has already stopped working.  I believe it is just a battery issue, but I have not been able to get a response back from the seller to see if we can resolve the issure.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked well for a year and a half. Now it is constantly crashing. Even after full powerwash.","positive":0},{"review":"  looks great, but after using it a couple times I realized I needed something with a DVD USB drive.","positive":0},{"review":"  I cant type certain letters and symbols. I had to use copy and paste to even use the letter p in this review. Yikes.","positive":0},{"review":"  Terrible stopped working 2 months later. Screen won't light up...","positive":0},{"review":"  Using this amazing laptop for two weeks now. I have to say my experience with this laptop has been great so far. There is no other available chromebook with such great specs at the price tag at the moment as of 5.28.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can give it 5 but have had it a day. Delivery and packaging great..I will be back to say but for now it's all good.","positive":1},{"review":"  A decent Chromebook ..  You can zoom on web page text but not on the menus bookmarks bar etc.  So why buy a high resolution screen if you have to lower resolution to read these items easily.","positive":1},{"review":"  First let me start by saying i was super skeptical of buying this chromebook. I've been using it for a week and a half now, and i can honestly say its one of the best laptops I've used in a while. there were also reports of people not receiving a charger with their purchase, but mine came with one, as well as a wireless mouse. as of now i honestly have nothing but positives for this laptop, but i will update my review if that changes in the near future.","positive":1},{"review":"  GOOD: 4 GB RAM, 32 GB storage, 2 USB 3.0 slots, generally snappy response, Android app capable, comfortable keyboardBAD: Proprietary Charger, no touchscreen, CAP LOCK key replaced with Chromebook SEARCH key, occasionally sluggish multitaskingOVERALL: For me it`s not quite a replacement for my MacBook Air, but it`s close enough for casual travel & home use - and at a hair over $200, it`s a real bargain.  I`d recommend it to almost anybody as a second PC, a guest laptop - or as the streaming music Chromecast sever we originally bought it as.","positive":1},{"review":"  I expect a factory refurbished unit to be perfect mechanically and functionally.  What I worry about are the cosmetics.  The sound is good, the screen is good, the keyboard is good, and the battery life is good.  I'm very happy, and would definitely repeat this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Aluminum case \u2018feels` MUCH more durable then plastic ones I was looking at.Standard keyboard, some say it is lacking in touch, I do not notice this or have troubles touch typing on it.So far I have had not issue with performance. Does what I want it to and does it quickly.","positive":1},{"review":"  My daughter loves it and uses it all the time with no complaints ever. If there was ANYTHING wrong with this Chromebook, she would let me know non-stop about the problem (believe me).fast and smooth. Definitely a 5-star review from me.","positive":1},{"review":"  The computer works fast enough, has a great battery life and is nice and lightweight so overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It's my first Chromebook, I've always had a traditional Windows laptop, so there are things it can't do and software it can't download, which was a bit of a let down, although that's probably on me not researching enough..no delete button.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a 2.5 year old 10.  The only downside is that it does not have an SD card slot but to be  honest I had one on my last chromebook and hardly filled it at all.  Anyway so far I am very pleased, but will update if anything changes.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the last time that I will buy a refurbished electronic.  As a teacher, I needed a laptop for my school work.  Then told to take it out to a repair shop.  What a waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  The laptop works great so far. However, the charger that was sent to me didn't work. I needed the computer to write a paper that night, and instead had to find other arrangements. I've also had to buy a third party charger to make it work.","positive":0},{"review":"  Advertised as a 2018 Acer chromebook. In fact it was manufactured May 2016. Wi-Fi broken. Acer said computer has been out of their system for over a year.","positive":0},{"review":"  do not buy it, it hasn't even been 6 months and my chrome book has been blacked out by half screen. I am very mad and sad..","positive":0},{"review":"  My chrome book had a dent on the bottom of it as well as having a hardware problem where the sound would not work. I factored reset it several times and it still did not work. I also received this chrome book in a dinky box that was practically dismantled with the added protection on the bottom of the chrome book. I just bought a brand new one on bestbuy for 30 bucks more.","positive":0},{"review":"  I never returned anything from Amazon. It is such a disappointment. I had to spend $43 at ups store to repack it, it was such a waste of money. Don`t buy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not come with a charger.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this device along with a case for my daughter for school on June 27, 2018. As of Oct 30, 2018, it won't power up. Have to send it off for repair.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not great of quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  There's a chip in the screen, a dent in the bottom of the chassis, and the screen intermittently goes black, only to reappear seconds later.the computer itself may be good, but the one I received was in disrepair.","positive":0},{"review":"  Pros:- Cheap, cheap, cheap. Great for college students on a budget- Fast startup and great battery life- Great for taking notes in class, working on projects and organizing your life. The more apps you use the more you get out of it- Audio quality is a joke, you're better off using headphones- You can only play games from Google Play, which means you can only play garbage mobile games. Pro Tip: You can download Xcom, Portal Bridge Builder, and Game Dev Tycoon from the Play Store, which are ported games that work pretty well- You have to get used to Chromes limitationsOverall if you're a college student with Gmail who needs a cheap laptop this is good for you.","positive":1},{"review":"  Best chrome book I've had.Ive had 3 hp 14's.. They never break.","positive":1},{"review":"  Arrived clean and in excellent working condition.  Performance is great, feels very sturdy.  I can play H.264 videos just fine with VLC on this Chromebook so I think I may be hitting a hardware limit where this Chromebook cannot decode the compressed video fast enough.","positive":1},{"review":"  I can't personally argue the cause for owning one, but I can shed perspective in these regards.  I purchased this for my parents who typically use a computer.  This has saved them from \"computer room\" visits, and does a great job for allowing them to use the computer for the light use of computing that they do, which is essentially all browser based.  If most of what one uses a computer for is a web browser, then this is worth a look noting it's a \"portable browser as an appliance\" device.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the money, these Chromebooks are great. I run my remodeling business from the field most of the time, and this is very light and sturdy enough to keep with me when I need to do a little more typing than is comfortable on a smartphone. Chrome OS quickness is great, and for a refurbished unit, I haven't had any issues so far. Not that I use them much, but the speakers are probably the loudest and nicest sounding of any laptop I've ever used.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought a dozen of these. They're pretty nice, with a slightly cheap feel to the keyboard and a chassis that flexes a little more than I'd like. Some of the machines had to be reset twice before the Play Store loaded. It was more work than I expected to do for a Chromebook.","positive":1},{"review":"  The construction and the weight are absolutely great. The battery life is more than enough, the screen is great.. Go ahead.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you work with work-groups using Drive, this is what you need. It's also good as a second computer if you need your work available in many locations. It's basically a big Android phone with the camera. and a big keyboard.","positive":1},{"review":"  As many have alluded to here, there is great value in this small package. Item was received in good condition. Great buy and would recommend if you just need this for browsing the internet, listening to music, watching videos and typing documents. I read that it is also able to run apps from the google playstore but I have not gotten around to it so I am unable to verify this for now.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a older version of Acer Chromebook but it broke after a few years. This one is much lighter and thinner, which makes it perfect for my daily use. I like it so much, so I got one more for my son. Still satisfied.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Chrome book seems great, but I did not receive a charger.  I can't seem to get a hold of anyone in order to get one.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's not so much that the thing is bad it just can't really do anything. The keyboard is weird too.","positive":0},{"review":"  frustated that wireless mouse does not work.  not tech support after 5pm eastern.","positive":0},{"review":"  this machine crapped out on my after 3 months. they only offered one month return period. Such BS.","positive":0},{"review":"  This refurbished chromebook didn't work upon arrival.  The screen kept flickering, and going on and off.  On a good note the machine is beautiful.  Just wished this one worked.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works like it should but right click is broken which is the reason for the 3-Star.Claims to be \"Certified refurbished\" yet you failed to catch the blatant broken button...","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing is a lemon. Do not buy. Battery is horrible. The cardboard box it came in is probably more valuable than the machine.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked for a year and a then died suddenly.","positive":0},{"review":"  Everything on the Laptop works fine. However, it was advertised that the Computer has 2.24GHz of processing power but I got a computer wit 1.60GHz of Processing power.","positive":0},{"review":"  product died after 6 month of use, it won't turn on.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for my girlfriend's grandma. I used to spend hours on the phone relaying instruction to them in Michigan to update windows or why she had this notification or that. Long battery life. I'd give it ten stars if I could.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great Chromebook for the money.  No touchscreen but does support Android apps.  Downside is that it has no USB C ports and a proprietary charger.  Refurb unit looked factory new   no marks or visible defects of any kind.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been using this device for a bit now and I'm a big fan.  I was a bit hesitant to try Chrome OS due to its inherent limitation of only running software from the Chrome store but so far so good.  The OS is fairly intuitive (it's essentially just a Chrome browser with some file support).  I highly recommend this device in particular and the Chrome ecosystem in general for basic computing needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best laptop I have ever owned, I really enjoy not having to worry about windows updates and viruses making my life difficult. For additionally complex tasks I use a linux chroot enviroment via crouton and xiwi to run linux applications in chrome tabs, this opens up the ability to add any functionality I need to an otherwise light browsing experience.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got it as a Christmas gift for someone and it`s pretty nice i used it for two weeks before wrapping it up so I`m not 100% sure how great it is but I know it looks amazing and it has great sound. I compared it to my to my MacBook Air 13inch and believe it or not it looks similar. The chrome book is just a little bigger.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ordered this for my adult son with autism. he loves searching the internet for heavy equipment and other interest areas.  This was perfect for his needs and the quality, HD screen and price were awesome ($40 less than BB big box store).He is just thrilled with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am the IT Director of my company and an IT Engineer with 30 years of experience. I bought this Chromebook for my 10-year old to use for school. The instant on is nice. The system is obviously immune to all forms of Windows specific malware.","positive":1},{"review":"  Based on my first 24 hours with the product:Pros:-great quality-great performance (everything opens instantly)-updated from OS 54 to 66 and had access to the play store immediately after the update-arrived fully chargedCons:-heavier then expected (nothing major)Other:-packaged extremely well-came with a unadvertised acer branded bluetooth mouse (thanks.)-magically it arrived in 4 days (shipped from USA to Canada)Thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop came in perfect conditions. No scratches, no dents, NOTHING. Instead I got one that has a jacked up keyboard LMFAOOO. Other than that it functions  like a dreammm.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just received this laptop and was very impressed with how it was packaged.  Very easy to log in and begin working on it.  Looks brand new, no scratches or dents.  Came with power cord and a bonus mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  Why is this rose gold... It is definitely not silver.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just had to return it, would not charge.","positive":0},{"review":"  Nice Chromebook but it made it 4 months before the screen died.  Don't expect much on a refurb but do expect a year of it working.","positive":0},{"review":"  Freezes. Battery give you 3 hours at best.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great Chromebook, however, it does not come with a charger so it's an extra $20 on top of it to get one. Inconvenient.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very disappointed that the screen went on the blink after the first month.","positive":0},{"review":"  DOA - Returned and bought an ASUS Chromebook.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm disgusted.","positive":0},{"review":"  Broken, will not turn on 9 months after purchasing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Actually I loved this machine, BUT it crapped out after 5 months and no one will touch it, return it or help me out with it in any way.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you are considering buying a Chromebook, this is definitely the model you should buy. The screen quality and size is perfect, the keyboard feels great to type on, the design is slick, track pad is perfect, the battery is like never ending, there are just so many pluses about this computer. I could not be any happier making this the laptop I use for my everyday life.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does exactly what I need, is responsive and super light weight.  I have traveled frequently since I got it and it is so easy to travel with whether in the car or on a plane.","positive":1},{"review":"  I waited some time to write my review, but as it sits, this is the best economical purchase for a chrome book, and since it has play store on it, it means you can do that much more.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this for my wife to replace her aging Toshiba Chromebook. She loves the build quality and full HD screen. As a husband life is so much better now that she's wearing headphones and I don't have to listen anymore. :)Great product, would buy again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought mine on Amazon Prime day and I had a great deal. I was a little bit reluctant because the price was really low.Even though it's refurbished it looks amazing. Just like new.","positive":1},{"review":"  Came w no damage and power cord along w Acer mouse. Battery life is excellent. I`m not the program downloader kind so its PERFECT and no viruses is something to look forward to. Thgt I`d miss my games but found several I can more than live with.","positive":1},{"review":"  It boots up fast, the interface is clean and simple. Clearly designed after Apple`s Macbook line (including the omission of a delete button). The screen could be a bit brighter, but overall a very good value for the price. It does what any chromebook should do, which is a simple laptop for internet access, nothing more.","positive":1},{"review":"  These laptop works great.  It's crystal clear picture. So research your printer before buying.  And for the price you absolutely can not go wrong.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little machine for me.  I am a college student and the battery is amazing and I like the Google  features as that is what we use at school.  It is light weight, easy to navigate and great for what I am using it for which is school.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far, very happy with this. I bought it for my kids to do their school based website work and it's been great. When my wife's laptop finally goes, I'll be getting a chromebook for her as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am writing this review on the Chromebook listed and luckily it arrived with 17%  charge which should be just enough to ask where the charger is. Can you send it to me. Please hurry. This is torture.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product will not work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love the sharp graphics and the compact size. The mouse that arrived with it does not work at all and the curser freezes up after about two or three minutes of use which is very frustrating.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am so highly disappointed the 3edc key stop working.

Unless you're doing nothing but Netflix and general web surfing then you'll be fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  I loved the light weight and long battery life. It would not run Skype which turned out to be a blessing as MS have changed it and it is no longer suitable for business. Using What'App on my phone instead and liking it more than Skype.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great laptop. I've never owned a Chrome device in the past.. it just works swell.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this Chromebook for my kids to do homework. The only problem has been them fighting over who gets to use it first :) Make sure to educate yourself on the limitations of Chrome OS. Zero problems and packaged the same as new. I would definitely purchase another to get the discount off retail.","positive":1},{"review":"  Dang but this is a good little Chromebook. Mind you, it won't replace a full-sized laptop PC, as there isn't muck storage, but for Web-surfing, etc, it's great. Powers up in about 6 seconds, battery life is around 7-8 hours depending on usage, AND I streamed a 1080p HD moivie last night..","positive":1},{"review":"  GOT THIS FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW AND SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL.

The volume is quirky, sometimes it's loud enough other times you can barelyhear it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very pleased with this chromebook.

If you can't tell, I really like it.","positive":1},{"review":"  200 dollars for it was definitely worth it. I use it at school for college and it is way better than taking paper notes. Save the trees people but it also is very light fits into my backpack.","positive":1},{"review":"  We just find this Chromebook very limiting functionally versus laptops. Would not buy anything like this again.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is not a computer for an adult to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  Returned, but did like size and OS. Just had a few problems I couldn't overcome.","positive":0},{"review":"  If I could give it negative stars I would. Only worked for 4 months, it is dead now. Very disappointed and dissatisfied.","positive":0},{"review":"  Came glitched.","positive":0},{"review":"  I know that the use of a Chromebook is limited, and I had accepted that fact when I originally ordered this computer. I thought that using Google docs would still be relatively easy on this device.

Unless you are only using this to access your email or YouTube, I would not suggest purchasing this device.","positive":0},{"review":"  shut off, and would not start as soon as I plugged in and turned on...","positive":0},{"review":"  Can not start.","positive":0},{"review":"  Mine didn't come with the charger nor did it come with a mouse like other's have said. I don't understand why or how it could come without a charger.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not include a charger. Otherwise in great shape.","positive":0},{"review":"  These guys are inexpensive, fast enough and have nice screens for the money. They're not the fastest Chromebooks, but they're a really great combination of price and form factor.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was surprised that seller didn`t know what model I bought. So it arrived and I am pleased. I prefer a more compact one with the plug built into the brick. Two cords suck.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am really enjoying this Chromebook. I find myself using it for 90% of my work. My only reservations are the brightness of the screen which could be better and the lack of keyboard lighting. But, as a previous reviewer mentioned, at this price, who can complain.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good one. Just what we need for my kids online learning.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is super solid - been giving them to the kids to use for school and they are hard on them..

Plenty fast enough.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Acer 14 has performed just as I expected. Based on two weeks of usage, I find it to be as quick as I expected. I enjoy the Larger 14\" screen. The only reservation that I have is that the matte screen is not as effective in reducing glare as an earlier Acer Chromeboon.","positive":1},{"review":"  While the Chrome OS takes some getting used to it allows installing Android phone tablet apps bringing a lot of functionality. The build quality is awesome for the price and the battery life is all day. It mirror's to the Chromecast without issue, and is a good fit for anyone who mostly web surfs, watches videos, and plays casual games. If you are someone who needs a specific app make sure it is available on Chrome or Android before buying this as your main system.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had my Chormebook for about a year now, still runs like new and I love it.

This works really well I shared my tile with my sister and I lost 1 of my cats in the parking lot I used the map and it lead me right to him , the other time 1 of them was hiding so I made the tile ring the noise is very subtle not loud at all if you are in close range you can hear it but if it's in another room you can't hear it it didn't bother my cat at all so that is a plus .I have it to dangle in the collar with there tag so this tile gets wet , dirty , scratched and it still works there is no malfunction the noise still sounds good it has a bit of scratches at the bottom but nothing to major , It's a bit big but it weighs nothing . I'm super extremely pleased with this gadget .","positive":1},{"review":"  As a Tile user since the beginning (when it was a start up product) I knew these were going to be a life saver for me.

Literally proved itself in the first day of having it.  Thankfully once I got home and opened the door.  There he was, tail-a-wagging and happy to see me.","positive":1},{"review":"  This just saved us $500.

One is on my normal backpack, one is on my backpack of videography gear, one is attached to my keys, and the last one is glued to my laptop. But when you're toting bags of expensive electronics around and don't want to lose them, the benefits of getting Tiles for them outweighs the cost. Mostly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE these. All sync well to my phone.If you are thinking about buying, do it. You won't regret keeping your important things at your fingertips.","positive":1},{"review":"  This item has helped me manage my chaotic life. My husband bought these as a gift for me while we were in the middle of a move.So far I have no complaints, and have found that even now that we are more settled in our house, I still use the tile to find my keys or wallet at least once a week.  A great gift from a thoughtful husband.","positive":1},{"review":"  I don't usually write a review unless an item is either fantastic or terrible.  At best, the tiles were fair to good when then picked up the signal, but they are a great concept.  Get something else.  They won't be around for long once the word gets out about this scheme.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great at finding anything in reasonable Bluetooth range. Cloud Find--not so much. In a place like a mall, with hundreds of people, you'd think we'd get hit after hit. But no.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unfortunately have to drop this to 1 star after losing a device and it not tracking correctly. This was the device on my wife's car keys and the day the keys were lost, it last reported the keys located somewhere 4 days prior (even though she drove to work that morning with her keys and wallet in the same vehicle but only her wallet Tile was updated correctly). No, I cannot use or recommend products where the company is not loyal to, or trusting of their customers. At this point, I'll use these until they die in about a year and at that point will look for other options.","positive":0},{"review":"  Simply put, on the surface the product works. I was able to know when my luggage was coming to me at the carousel in an airport. yet due to their app it wouldn't go passed 10 hours.Thanks, but no thanks.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just received an email from the  company offering to \"Re-tile\"my tiles as the battery (not replaceable save for cutting open the plastic case to which it is housed with a dremel like device - see photo) is only good for a year. The manufacturer has \"designed obsolescence\" to keep you coming back each year to purchase new ones.. And they have also made their website overly complex in the tracking of your tiles.","positive":0},{"review":"  Day 1 - 2016-05-11 - 2 Stars2 stars = I don't like it, according to Amazon's star ratings, that sounds about right so far.I will edit as time goes by, but I already am not a fan. Since this thing was only $25 bucks, I think I'm just going to take some find grit sand paper or maybe a dremel tool and rout out the edges of this thing just a tiny bit. It has not disconnected from my phone at all since my last update, so at least, as far as I've noticed, it doesn't just randomly drop connection.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought the Tile Gen 2 with the hope that I could use it as an effective tracker for my valuable items. It also sounded like a good alternative to the more expensive GPS tracker which requires monthly fees. But it is clearly an ineffective product beyond that based on my own tests. There are also many other trackers on the market nowadays which provides similar functionality without annual renewal fees.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've already lost two sets of keys with Tiles attached to them. Each time I immediately checked the app after misplacing the keys (within an hour), when I check the app it tells me that the last time it saw the Tile connected to my keys was over a week ago. The last Tile I gave away as a gift, which reminds me I need to check on the person I gave that to. I wouldn't recommend this purchase.","positive":0},{"review":"  I would have thought that Tile would have a better discount for those of us that ordered their products.  The \"Tiles\" only have a one year life due to the planned end-of-life that's built into the product by Tile...","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is really useless.  When it's working, the beep is too low to be helpful. the key has been in Los Angeles for months.The concept behind the product is good, but the product sucks.","positive":0},{"review":"  I chose this over its competitors due to its form factor, superior app, and larger network.The tiles are small and lightweight.Tile has a lifelong customer, and I won't hesitate to recommend this product to others.  Given that the cost of replacing the newer keyless entry keys will cost hundreds of dollars, this is an absolute no-brainer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the Tile hardware itself and the product as a whole is top notch. For the most part they work just as I hoped and will sound when told to and help me find my stuff when I misplace it.--Conclusion--I highly recommend these for anyone who occasionally looses their stuff. The only way they could improve the product is to let you set certain tiles to automatically sound or have the app warn you when you get too far from them, useful for things you are always going to need like keys or flash drive.","positive":1},{"review":"  I keep Redfoot Tortoises as pets in my backyard (see photo). One of them has recently become an escape artist, using his brother to boost over the fence and wander off into my thickly planted tropical property. It's not as accurate as a Bluetooth link, and you can't make the Tile chip ring. Still, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Tile as a tracking device.","positive":1},{"review":"  These just work..  The bottom line is that Tiles last more than a year, and they've *so far* offered deep discounts to \"re-tile\" (swap old for now, with a recycling envelope).  The best would be wireless Qi charging, but I suspect the economics wouldn't work out quite yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have tried many different bluetooth trackers and have been let down by pretty much all of them.  They all have their shortcomings, and most simply didn't work.  It has also helped me in finding my phone.  It may not have connected features like XY or Pebblebee that allow you to connect it to IFTTT and it may only last a year before needing to be replaced due to a dead battery, but it is the most reliable bluetooth tracker out of the bunch.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought a 4-pack for my wife in Sept 2015. She had tried other lost key finders in the past but they were poor quality and not reliable. to make the house silent then it can be heard.Overall we are very pleased, the Tile is far more reliable and robust than other solutions we have tried in the past.","positive":1},{"review":"  Well I am coming up on 1 year now and I bought 4 tiles.  Two I am using one for my keychain and the other for my bike...","positive":1},{"review":"  Update September 18, 2015* For me the primary functions works as advertised.

I use these religiously, often to find my glasses case or my wallet.I have only had to contact the company one time and they responded within an hour. I can wholeheartedly endorse this as among my favorite products.","positive":1},{"review":"  We use these for our keys and our cats. Yep. The one issue is that it`s supposed to pick up the signal within 100ft I believe, but when one of the cats was hiding at one end of the house, it couldn`t pick up the signal halfway to the other end (our house is 72ft long).I do love the feature that allows other people`s Apps to pick up on the signal and tell you where it is if it gets lost (it doesn`t tell them, just you).","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought 8 of these.

Since then I had misplaced my phone or keys a few time. It is frustrating that other unimportant apps would constantly stay running in the background on my phone but tile would just shut down by itself when I kept opening it. I wish I could return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really excited to start using my tile when I first received them.I had no idea the battery was only supposed to last a year and that the battery can not be replaced. If I could do it over again, I would not have purchased this item. Big thumbs down.","positive":0},{"review":"  The obvious problem is that I never lose anything big enough to stick a tile to it. That's on me.The battery on mine is about to die. I'm not going to replace it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product works for one purpose: if I am in the same room with my keys and push the button on my phone I can find them.  But if you've lost something and you're hoping to figure out where, forget it. I have very little faith now that this would happen. So if you commonly misplace your keys in your house, it's good for tracking those down.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am always losing my keys, so after ripping my house apart for three days, I swore I'd get some sort of a key finder. I looked at a few different brands and decided to try the Tile. It's maddening about the Bluetooth pairing, but I'm sure that the next time I lose my keys, finding them will make up for this. I'd be willing to bet that a year from now, the Tile will have some strong competition.","positive":0},{"review":"  The tiles don't work as advertised. When I press the button on my phone that is supposed to locate the tile nothing happens...","positive":0},{"review":"  Based on positive reviews, I bought this.  Before I opened the package, I happened to meet a person who had tried the Tile.  When you go on their download website you get a very polished video.  Maybe most all such location finding devices have similar problems, but this one has bugs for sure as far as my experience goes.","positive":0},{"review":"  Edit .. In summary, these are so much better than the junk key finders I got before from other places. This kit also came with two black round stickers which I have no idea what they are for.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased 5 of these between my husband and me (key and wallet variety) Huge waste of money. They would not maintain their connection to our phones (Samsung Galaxy S5 and S7)  We set them up, they worked, then a few days later they would stop connecting. (Proven by our battery meter app on the Samsung phones which tells you what app is using your battery) Their technical support replaced two of them, but when the replacements were no better we gave up. Wish I had all that money back instead of useless dead key fobs and wallet cards.","positive":0},{"review":"  I want to start by saying there is some incremental value in these tiles but don't expect to loose your keys and community find them. It is next to impossible and NOT because of the number of people but the tech.With that being said they make a great find my keys when it is in range but thats all you should expect. These will NOT find your keys if you loose them out of range consider them GONE.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was uncertain if this would meet my need for tracking my two cats.  My keys and phone were secondary (as I got the four pack).  Within that limit these are greatly reducing my stress and ease getting out of the house in a hurry.  One day I will get a GPS tracker for the cats in case the run away but for now the tiles meet our needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  I used to forever lose things so I bought one Tile to try it out, then got the 4-pack. I keep the location setting off most of the time because I noticed it drained my battery quite a bit, but also because I like privacy and keep location off for almost all of my apps. I might go down to just one or two. There are so many services these days that I'm paying an annual fee for (and this is essentially an annual fee since you can't replace the batteries yourself) and I feel like I'm just not using them much.","positive":1},{"review":"  I tried an early version of a similar product a while ago. Returned it. Now granted, this isn't solving world hunger but it is a sweet little techno convenience. And when you add it to the other things it does so well it's just one more reason to buy Tile.","positive":1},{"review":"  I only gave this 4 stars because it will not find my iPhone 6 Plus.  It does however, always find my keys, my pursue and my wallet every time I use it.  I immediately went looking for my phone and found it.  I know with all the blue tooth cars people do not use the ear pieces much much but I sincerely believe I would have lost my phone had I not been wearing one so don't leave homewithout mine.","positive":1},{"review":"  I highly recommend the Tile.  While I generally clip my keys to my purse, I've had a couple times where my house key ring slipped off the carabineer.  She was able to slip her hand into the spot between the seats- exactly where my keys had fallen.  Had I purchased my Tile before that, I would have just used the app and known to go to my car and follow the sound.","positive":1},{"review":"  These things have saved me several times.  I am horribly disorganized in the morning.  They do not have any GPS technology in them.  They are exactly what I needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  Well, I can find my keys and my glucometer with no problems, but the find my phone feature doesn't really work. I was communicating with technical support regarding this problem, and they told me it's a known issue and that the next app update should solve the problem..a battery is cheaper.","positive":1},{"review":"  It all seemed good unless I lost my phone THEN what would I do.  Only I could lose my purse w phone in the first week of owning the Tiles.I got online and easily found that the purse was not in the house,  The online program displayed a map of the area and address the Tiles had last been sensed.BOOM  I drove back and got my purse.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you are always misplacing your key or phone you can not go wrong with this product. I am always trying to find my keys or phone around the house, at work or even in my purse. I have had to use it to do both. It has definitely saved me time searching around the house, especially when I am running late for work.","positive":1},{"review":"  * Update: Add another star because the customer service helped me with the \"feature\" and fairly quick transferring the tile to another account. However, I can't deactivate it nor pair the tile myself anymore. Can't be security because we can just set up a pin code or automated email confirmation to deactivate a tile.

This means that misplacing a tiled key chain in one building probably will not register. But if you misplace things around the house more than I do, this might be the thing for you. The blue tooth range is a limitation for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  Troublesome product. I purchased a pack of 4 to give to family. I hope I saved some people a major hassle.Too many negatives to repurchase or recommend.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ive had my tiles for a few months now.  I have used them multiple times to find things Ive misplaced.  Im also pretty rough with my keys and the Tile on my key ring is still holding up fine.

Can last up to 12 months, but 6-9 if used regularly (which is still a long time).Con:When I press the tile button twice, it`s supposed to make my phone ring, but it only works half the time.

I have one on my keys..  Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Find where you parked your car.  Tile is making a hype about this and I don't find that it works as well as they claim.  Anyway, it will get you close, but it's still not perfect.Bottom line: four stars because I like the Tile, but it isn't perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought a 4-pack of tiles maybe 6 months ago.

They all failed miserably.  So yep -- 4.9999 stars (get coding, Tile Team.","positive":1},{"review":"  This little tile works fairly well. My cat got out a week ago and we couldn't find her for a couple of days, which worried my wife and I because we just moved into a new neighborhood.

Anyways, I'm sure it could be improved but the price is unbeatable and installation is super easy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love tiles.  I have them currently on my car keys, spare keys, in my car (because I lose it a lot in parking lots), and my wallet. should develop some sort of recycling system and give a discount to any \"returned\" tiles that no longer function.  Or offer a battery replacement option that is reasonably priced (maybe cost of battery batteries and shipping).","positive":1},{"review":"  I've tried the other brands that have started making similar devices, and none stack up. I always come back to Tile. Plus the first time someone loses their keys and has to use it, they will think of you and thank you again for the $25 gift (which never happens with a scarf).I do wish they were a little smaller and better looking, but the smaller better-looking ones just aren't\u200b as good yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I first got it, it worked pretty well.  That lasted for about a day, then after that it really didn't function reliably at all.  I could likely have gotten a replacement, but I didn't want to risk it going off in the middle of work again.  Overall, I can't recommend this.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great product.  I got it as a gift for my spouse, as she tends to misplace both her keys and her phone, although thankfully not both at the same time.

Also, drop your keys in the yard or leave them in the car, forget it.This company will make money because it's a cute idea, but these things are nothing but a con, with technology that's not even close to what it's advertised to be.","positive":0},{"review":"  The Tile is a simple tracking device for your keys or really anything you want to attach it to. Its operation is very simple. That would seem to be a pretty simple feature to add.

There's only 1 set of instructions and the 4 tiles come together in 1 piece of foam that is adhered to cardboard.

Had I known, I would have purchased just 1.","positive":0},{"review":"  Using these with a OnePlus 3 for close to a year now.

The most frustrating thing out of the box is they are not designed to replace the battery.

Several people in my wife's social circle have already noticed here using the tile to find her keys and were instantly sold to go and order themselves a couple.","positive":0},{"review":"  EDIT: After about a month of use, I have been very disappointed with the reliability of my Tiles. Strangely, the original one for my laptop seems to still work reliably, but the two I have activated from this four pack I bought leave something to be desired.The app works great, setup was a breeze. The only thing stopping me from buying more is the budget of a college student.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've purchased this brand for three years now. My daughter in law kept losing her cell phone so I thought our whole family could use this. It works great but only last one year.","positive":1},{"review":"  These are great for finding whatever you attach them to.  As far as gifts go, a set of four of these hit way above their price range, with this being the gift that got shown off first while more expensive ones stayed under the tree.  After that you can click the Tile and the phone will ring, but by the next day, and probably by the time you need to find your phone it will be disconnected again.  I have not drilled down into the phone settings to see if it is an option to keep it connected all the time because the main purpose of the Tiles in our case was to alleviate the several times per day searching for the car keys and for that the Tiles work great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have never lost my keys ever since using the title. True story, I lost my keys at the airport. I was able to retrieve my keys back when I landed.I love the tile.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is incredibly helpful, however there are some downfalls that I wish would be modified in this product: 1) it isn't very loud: the ringing is helpful to find if you are in a silent room without the fan on. 2) you can't replace the batteries: when your Tile dies you have to buy another one. I'm not really one to leave items places so the GPS function on the APP isn't super helpful but I like the idea that if I needed it, it would be beneficial. I do use the ringing feature very frequently as often I have left it in my room or bathroom.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this with the intention to put it on my cat who has a tendency to get out (she opens doors) when it's that time of the year..

It works exactly as described.  Just having the Tile up on my phone used 9% of the phone's battery by running on the background.

It has been freezing lately. It's happened to me where I rely on this so much that one day I'll completely freak out when I can't find my keys 10 minutes before I have to leave the house and that's a nightmare. Also you can't get this wet or it will stop working (Mine got bbq sauce on and it ruined it) I really think the first generation of tiles and application was better than this one but I will most likely rebuy it because I lose things too much and it's better than nothing.","positive":0},{"review":"  I  use tiles on my key ring to help me find my phone, which I lose all the time.

I am so thankful for this little device.","positive":1},{"review":"  I initially used chipolo because I thought the product design was more attractive and you can change the battery.

The app is simple and the customer service excellent.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update - reduced stars from 3 to 1 ft er few week using it9 times of of 10 you can hold your phone 1 inch over the tile and neither devices will find each other - blue tooth fully enable - finds devices 30 40 feet away from iPhone - not the tile 1 inch below though.Hype and uselessReally wanted to like this given all the positive reviews and hype. Unfortunately, the range bye phone and tile is rather limited - in some case it can't locate   connect less than 3 ft from the tile.","positive":0},{"review":"  This has been a big disappointment. Two of the tiles we received barely ever connect and can't be detected even when testing from within one foot, 5 feet, 10 feet, etc. The frustration is then when you follow the steps they tell you to connect them and they still don't work. I think we got duds.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought a four pack of these and my only complaint is that after eight or ten hours the link between Tile App and the tiles goes down and does not work again unless my device is restarted and, when I say my device I should say my devices because I linked them to four different phones (different makes, models, etc...  that doesn't help me.","positive":0},{"review":"  It does not work .  Cannot get it to link with my cell phone .","positive":0},{"review":"  Works OK. Someday they'll make the buzzer loud enough to hear past 4 feet away.Still a good tool for when you're driving and have misplaced your phone or it's fallen in some crevasse in the cabin, you squeeze the tile on the key ring and your phone signals.

And if it's not connected all the time, that's hard to do when you can't find your phone. Catch 22 of uselessness.","positive":0},{"review":"  These are a neat idea but they do not function as gloriously as described.  The Tile app must always be open in the background in order for it to work (conversely to what they say about going into the app settings and select \"find tiles while app closed.

I contacted the rental company and they searched and found my bag. Whew, what a great find.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to track my cat.  It's a little large on his collar, but he seems to be okay with it.  Because of the $25 price of this, I feel like I got my money's worth.

Gone are the times spent wasting 5,10,15,30 minutes trying to get out of the house.

Ignore my review pretty much. So after the factory reset, it just doesn't detect my tile.

It's reliant upon strangers for basic needs outside of close range, which would work a lot better in tech-driven cities than suburbs. Spend it if you like tech toys.

Works well. On the upside the bulkiness of the Tile means it's harder to lose the remote. Kind of a waste for us.","positive":0},{"review":"  I rate this product as solid 5 because it does exactly what it is designed to do and does so very well.One thing that is not very obvious from photographs (but is stated clearly in specification) is that the device is a bit thick.

I hope, in future releases, designers will think of a way to make it half as thick and just as durable.","positive":1},{"review":"  So, I lose my keys on an almost daily basis, even after having a hook installed right by the door where I come inside. Since I installed the Tile, I've misplaced them twice, and was easily able to find them.mornings where I am trying to get out the door for work and I can't find my keys are horribly stressful and they set a bad tone for the rest of the day - but the Tile has helped alleviate that already.It IS a bit on the big side, which I find odd - I don't know why they can't make it skinnier, but other than that, it's pretty much perfect for people like me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this for my fianc\u00e9 who is always losing his keys or his phone. Though there is an apple feature to find his phone, his keys were another story. It is also a bit thicker than I expected.

He loves it and everyone who has asked about them is really interested, my mom bought them right away when we told her about them.

You can not hear in a pocketbook or under a sweater.  It is better than nothing, if you are right on top of something you know you didn't leave it somewhere else.  They caught me for 2 generations, no more.","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased the four pack.  Really wanted these to work well.  Don't know.  After trying for a couple of hours I finally returned to Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'd be happier if the tile worked all the time. In other words there are times when you have to figure out where the heck it is before you can find it. This does not do that. It is helpful but in a limited way.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a gadget guy, I have many.  So, I know how to use them.  There is another company that does the same thing, but has a battery that can be replaced.  I think I will try that option.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like the tile and it's purpose.  It has been wonderful when finding the phone and  my keys.  So you can't forget to leave them both on or the tile is of no use.  If you are always losing your keys or whatever you hook it up to, then it's way worth the downsides, but if you don't misplace things that often, not sure it's worth the eating up of your battery life.","positive":0},{"review":"  Doesn't work, or to be more precise, works only part way.  Phone will find my keys but not the other way around.  I wouldn't buy again until they fix the existing problems.  It doesn't impress me when they are constantly trumpeting, \"New Features\" when the basic ones don't work.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a great product..  Hoping future versions address this issue.  Again, I love the product concept, and for the first month, I loved the product, but I was very disappointed by how quickly we lost functionality.","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased a set of 4 and gifted over the holiday. My husband and dad seem to use it regularly. Unfortunately the battery only last 1yr which requires the whole unit to be replaced vs just the battery. A few tweaks and this could be an amazing product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Thank god for this product.. its easier said than done with two kids and multiple bags etc. I am buying these for christmas for my parents keys.","positive":1},{"review":"  Although I wrote a poor review earlier, the company contacted me and gave me very helpful steps to figure out what was wrong.Just a heads up: If your Tile plays an odd tune and isn't showing up \"in range\" on the app, simply delete that tile from the app, and repeat the activation process you did upon first activating it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this everyday.  I constantly lose my keys.  Also, you really are playing hot and cold as you try to find your tile.  Regardless, once you are within range it will ring the ttile so it is great for the technology that it is.","positive":1},{"review":"  Seems to work very nice however I would have liked to see two things be included  that were not part of its functionality features.-Removable battery-The ability to locate your phone with the push of the tile button (rather then with another device that has the app)The functionality of locating with another app is already built into IOS Android (Find my iphone device manager) and they already do it very well. Tile should make their product stand out by triggering the iphone with the tile, just my two cents.Overall decent product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love them.  Works exactly as described.  I'm not complaining, it's a very nice feature.  Out of all the times I carry a wallet in my back pocket, I've only 'sat on it wrong' that one time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was happy that this pretty much performed as advertised. I hung one on my small cat's collar so that I would always know where she is around my house and not be worried...","positive":1},{"review":"  for someone who has to look every morning for his wallet and car keys, this has saved me countless hours of looking around the house for my things before I leave to work. when you open the app, it will tell you if all your tagged belongings are with you our u have left something behind. When I arrived to the office, the app let me know that my tile was found. Good for the local, not for long distance.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works on Moto X Pure Style cell with Android 6.0.50 currently seems high from TILE, too, especially as battery only good for a year. But overall love this problem solving device for keys phone finding.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've always been one of those people who will have to search for something at least once or twice a week.  I always seem to loose the same things that I grab daily, my work keys, my car keys, and my wallet.  It's a great way to find something quickly, or find out where you left something.I only gave this item four stars because the end user cannot replace the battery if needed.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this for an ex while we were dating because he's constantly misplacing his wallet. I bought it while his wallet was actually completely missing (he never got it back) but he hasn't left it anywhere outside his home since then so he hasn't had the chance to test out the more advanced features. I asked him to let me know if he ever loses his wallet for real. But as far as he's needed it, he says it's been a great help.","positive":1},{"review":"  At first, I was enthralled with these clever gadgets. however, this thought occured before I discovered that they did not always, or even half of the time, pick up on the other tile. I could see no apparent reason why this box ended up who knows where before being returned to me.I will call in the morning, and I will resend these items AGAIN.","positive":0},{"review":"  The emitting alarm could be heard possibly perhaps only by a cat - the audible signal is too low for an average human ear, not to mention by an elderly person. If it was primarily designed for use by a senior citizen, then don't bother getting it. However, it does work fine in reverse, when one is trying to locate the misplaced iPhone since the audible signal on the phone can easily by adjusted to a higher volume. IMO it's a worthless gadget for any baby boomer.","positive":0},{"review":"  This thing is cool, it made a great gift for my mum who loses everything. The one, and greatest downfall is that the batteries only last a year and you can't change them. The other not-great thing is that you have to have your phones Bluetooth on all the time for it to work. That is a battery killer, but not a huge deal of you have access to a charger most of the time.","positive":0},{"review":"  It simply doesn't work. It worked for a week when I installed the app and tested it, but for the few times I've lost my keys it has not made any noise at all. I spoke to customer service and they tried everything to get it working again but it seems mine is just faulty. What a waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  My understanding when I bought this that it was new. It is not. I cleaned it with windex and decide to use it. Not happy that the amount of use was not disclosed.","positive":0},{"review":"  We've had them for a year, with mixed experiences. They generally work as expected, so one press and you can locate your keys. we are deciding not. We are teaching our kid to reuse and recycle, and it's sad that this device does not allow for those options.","positive":0},{"review":"  I think I got used goods.Because the package was torn and there was foreign substance.Its battery life is very important, so I feel bad that I got the used one.I just keep using because it is annoying to return it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I should have read the description better..  I can appreciate the discount that Tile is providing, however not sure if it's worth my  $ to purchase another set of Tiltes.  Product worked as advertised, but didn't last as long as hoped for.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works as advertised.  I was a little worried about the app after reading some of the comments, but I didn't have any problems, It works like a charm.  I would like it if it was a little louder, but that is my only complaint so far.  Plan to order for mother who has problem misplacing keys.","positive":0},{"review":"  This tile died after one months use and just missed the window to return it to Amazon.  I suspect the battery is dead but cannot open the device since it is glued shut.  Checking your phone to see if you Tile is still active is not on my radar screen unless I actually lose my possession.  If the battery is dead and I don't know it what good is TILE.","positive":0},{"review":"  So far I love it.  I'm good at losing my keys, so I'm hoping this will help. I'm sure it will.  I don't mind the battery situation since the cost of a battery would probably be about the same as getting a new Tile, plus, by a year or more they will probably do an upgrade anyway.","positive":1},{"review":"  What a terrific product. When I misplace my phone, I can't call it because I don't have a landline, so I just tap the tile on my key ring and the phone starts chirping almost instantly...","positive":1},{"review":"  What a great idea. I bought these as gifts and also kept one for myself. I live in an apartment complex and learned when I set up my Tile that there are 131 members of the community within bluetooth distance of my apartment. Who knew.","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely fantastic.  I have 4 activated and they have been accurate and helpful.  I was able to locate my phone which I had misplaced by using a tile itself to track back.  For the price and the battery life anticipated these are certainly worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered these so my husband could attach one to his drone in case it ever decided to fly off on it's own.  Good thing I purchased the 4 pack because he has one on his keys now and one in his wallet too.  We have also had to use that function.  He has been non-stop singing the praises of the tile.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this in my suitcase when I travel.  Luckily I have not had to use it for lost luggage, but if I do, I think the system they have in place will be effective in locating the luggage.  Since I've had the product, the company has made a few improvements, fine tuning the app and system and adding new features.  I look forward to more.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love my Tile. I was given one as a gift, which I attached to my keys, and I loved it so much I bought one myself, which I keep in the coin pocket of my wallet.I have recommended Tile to friends, and will continue to do so. This product is wonderful.","positive":1},{"review":"  As an old geezer who constantly forgets where he puts stuff, I have found this gadget invaluable. I put one on my keys and one in my wallet, and have saved countless hours of searching. The only problem (and the only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5) I've had is that the signal sounds are not as loud as I would like, especially for my wallet. From inside my wallet, I can barely hear it unless I am quite close.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ordered a 4 pack and put 1 on my key chain and one of each of three cats.  Works great to find them when they are hiding or when they sneak outside. I will likely buy the new smaller version to replace the current model on my cats. Would purchase again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this Tile (Gen 2) for my wife over a month ago. This product is great. The battery is said to last a year but as much as my wife uses it to find her keys phone I doubt the battery will last that long. When the battery dies I will use their battery replacement program.","positive":1},{"review":"  It works about %50 of the time. It keeps losing connection to where if I click the tile to find my phone it doesn't work. Expensive for a product that works half the time. I was hoping to buy 4 of them as gifts but that's definitely not happening now.","positive":0},{"review":"  I brought 12 tiles. Wanted to gift them to friends this holiday. But I think they are just not there yet.  I will love change this review to 4 starts if you fix Android 6.","positive":0},{"review":"  It's ok for finding keys once but finding the phone function hardly ever works. I always find the app is somehow disconnected.  And again, it couldn't find a phone right next to me.Thanks for nothing Tile.","positive":0},{"review":"  It works to find your keys, but rarely works to find your car. You can \"ring\" your keys from your phone which is nice (and vice versa) but only about half the time will it know where your car is located.  Just not a good car finder in the city.  and that's what I bought them for.","positive":0},{"review":"  After receiving the Tile, I added my iPhone.  I then added my keys.  I didn't add the iPad it automatically added the iPad when it was near the app and the app was open.Way too much going on with this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought these for my daughter who was going out of state for school for her luggage and purse.  She left 2 months ago, and the last time my app has seen her items was when she was home.  I thought these would be more helpful if you lost your luggage at an airport, but seems that not enough other users out there so was pretty much a worthless expensive buy.  It works great for local items you make have lost in your home like keys, and such but not as helpful for items going long distance.","positive":0},{"review":"  Update my review after several month usage to drop it from 4 to 2 stars. The reason is that when you not always check you tile with the App it do not work especially for some use case. I have very little use of it and quickly it more often irritates me than it makes me happy. So shortly forget that it detects where a \"thing\" was seen last.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works OK, not great.  Sound is so low from the key fob, I can't hear it unless I'm in the same room with it.  That feature used to work, but no longer (I have 2 of these and both are the same).  I know, you have to keep both the Ap and Blue Tooth active on your phone, still doesn't work and my phone battery doesn't like Blue Tooth on 24-7's.","positive":0},{"review":"  This item sounds too perfect to be true and it is.  The app on your phone must remain open 24 7 for it to communicate with the tile. While testing it out with the app on and active, bluetooth on and connected to WIFI and GPS, it just didn't connect.  I think this technology is very much needed, but not yet ready for prime time.","positive":0},{"review":"  They are generally reliable, and I've used them to find my keys and wallet a number of times. But one of my four tiles died after only eight or nine months, and the feature to call for or find your phone (by pressing the Tile, itself) is unreliable.","positive":0},{"review":"  This was such a great purchase.  I bought it a month ago as a gift for my husband, who would spend way too much time searching for his wallet each morning.  I bought this for the price, and to test out if a 'wallet phone finder' device would be something that would come in handy.  We definitely use it often and it works great, but I think once the battery dies, we'll likely spend more money for a slimmer style with a rechargeable battery.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works perfectly as advertised. For those wondering if it indeed does work in your wallet: it works in mine. My wallet is about 1-1.5 inches thick when folded.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you are an ADD-addled soul who is constantly misplacing things around the house, wondering if you left your wallet at the restaurant, or unsure where your keys are, this is worth every penny.  I have no idea why I waited so long to get them.  I put them on my dogs' collars, too.  (It's no substitute for a microchip, but it's great if you're like, \"HMM, is Fido hiding under the deck or has he somehow escaped.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it. Use it to track my cat. I think he's used to lots of cell phone sounds so this didn't appear to bother him. He's kind of a drama queen, so I imagine the feel and sound would not be too stressful for most cats.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great solution for anyone that constantly loses their wallet, keys, phone, purse, etc.  The device is very useful as it doubles as a finder for your phone, by clicking on the tile twice.  The setup and installation of Tile is very user friendly and easy to use.  I love it and can't wait to continue to use it.","positive":1},{"review":"  First of all, this is a great product that does what it's intended to do.I bought the tile for my wife because she ALWAYS loses her keys and we end up wasting minutes before heading out the door looking for them. You will definitly find a use for the others. Plus you save some money buying more.","positive":1},{"review":"  Only thing I would recommend is that they try to make it smaller, or the battery last longer.It's kind of chunky, even the Gen 2.It's great for finding keys in the morning.  It's also good for finding your phone, but the Tile App must be up on your phone for this to work.","positive":1},{"review":"  My wife's car keys and fob are a specialty item that, if lost, would cost over a $1,000 to replace. Needless to say the one time we have had to use this device it paid for itself many times over.Note that the \"crowd-finding\" support really only works in more populated areas where there will be others with the device near your's, but even without that, its is well worth the price to protect valuable items.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ah.. You can use your phone to find your keys (which will have the tile on them), and you can use the tile to find your phone (double click the \"e\" and your phone rings).Rarely, does a product come around that just makes life slightly easier without changing much--this is it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does seem to work.  I've never put it to the test on anything at a distance, though.  I'm hoping we will not  have the losing track problem at the mall again.For those who wonder, we do not own any smartphones, so we have no way to find each other except by Tile.","positive":1},{"review":"  Couldn`t figure out ok how to activate I searched YouTube and the instructions are only on the app you download , the only instructions you get in the box only directs you to downloading the damn app I plan To get a FULL refund.","positive":0},{"review":"  Have two of these, one for my wife and one for myself. They do not work 90% of the time. Nothing. Great idea but not very good execution.","positive":0},{"review":"  For some reason, my phone would lose connection with my tile. Couldn't ring it or use it to ring my phone. Before I charged my phone once a day. With it, two or three times a day.","positive":0},{"review":"  These tiles are programmed to die after one year.  Tile has no telephone support. Save your money and find a better alternative. Total crap.","positive":0},{"review":"  After two months I'd press the Tile button while the fob was right next to the phone and it wouldn't recognize it. I reset my phone, the fob, everything, but nothing would get it working. I hope the extra ounces of the fob inconvenienced the thief in some way, at the least.I contacted Tile and didn't get a response.","positive":0},{"review":"  Easy to install and easy to work the app. I am running off of the same battery almost 2 years later. The volume is lower than I would like. Easy to hear if the keys are sitting on the counter but if they fell into the couch or something like that it can be difficult to hear.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this in April. I really liked how it worked until the battery died.  Too bad because I would have bought more. Of course after reading all the negative reviews about the company, probably not.","positive":0},{"review":"  Purchased 7 14 16 and they died pretty much to the day one year later. Tile support says they only last a year, so basically we're supposed to buy new ones year. Enormous waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  To find items in your house or car, this is not a bad option. However, as a locator in the world at large, it does not seem to be very effective..but I have just not been impressed with locating items outside my home.","positive":0},{"review":"  If I could give 0 stars, I would. I was actually very excited to receive this product. Don't buy from Amazon. Either buy directly from the Tile site, or find another product.","positive":0},{"review":"  After my husband went through a spell of losing anything and everything I ordered. What a great idea this product is. Setup for this was very easy. These tiles have saved us a lot of time and worry when things get misplaced.","positive":1},{"review":"  While this is not perfect, it has saved me enough times that I had to give a good review. Today my keys were wedged in my couch.I can hear my tile clear across the house when it is in open air but have been unable to hear it from just a foot or two when it is concealed.There have been a couple of times when I had difficulty setting off the Tile.","positive":1},{"review":"  Love it..Most important thing..","positive":1},{"review":"  I love my Tile. I purchased the Tile over other trackers based on feedback from friends who had the Tile and other brands. Or Where is my phone. Then I highly recommend you grab a Tile.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use it multiple times a day to locate, my car keys, work keys, kids keys or one of our phones. I need about 8 more. I recommend this for the super forgetful or the super busy which often creates a super forgetful person. if you are juggling many things in different areas of your life it's sometimes difficult to remember where you set your work keys down etc.","positive":1},{"review":"  Let's see. I can't find my keys. Get this, even if you never use it. If when the battery does eventually die,(1 year minimum) they have a trade in system for cheap.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far so good. Loud, and worked in my leather bifold wallet when stuffed in a drawer in the back of the house. I wish they could make tile a little thinner though. It is also the thickness of a piece of actual tile- would be nice if it were like the thickness of a piece of cardboard or better yet, a credit card.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love these.  I lose my house keys, car keys or one of the TV remotes A LOT, and Tile has been a lifesaver. That would have been a nightmare but was no problem at all with Tile. I don't mind re-tiling yearly for something that hels me this much.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product. I regularly misplace my cell phone and keys.

First of all I loose my keys all the time so I bought this. I was under the impression that it would show the location and could do a bit better than 10 feet.

It's pretty bulky, so I wouldn't want to have it on my key ring in my pocket.","positive":0},{"review":"  they are only good for a year so you'll have to pay again next year making them a pretty expensive investment.  one didn't work and returning it was a real pain.  just send me a new one and I'll send you back your old one or you can charge my card.  Also, you must have the phone app running at all times if you want to find the phone so that runs down battery and you have to remember to have it on.","positive":0},{"review":"  Often times it does not update the phone with it's location when it is near to the phone unless they are near each other for a long time. It does not give me much confidence.","positive":0},{"review":"  I want to love it, I really do, but it just doesn't seem to work that great. The app has to constantly be running with bluetooth on and it does run down the phone battery. If I am upstairs in my house and my keys are downstairs, it's unable to find them. I hope to see it evolve into a wonderful product, but definitely needs some work.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works great but unfortunately I can't use to find husband's camera when he's almost 2,000 miles away.  He doesn't have a Smart phone and I guess there's a distance limit.  Just received notice from Tile that my tile was anonymously located in another state, which is correct as my husband is traveling and tile is attached to his camera strap.  I am impressed.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought a set of 4 of these to put on all of my car keys... As nice as the customer service at Tile has been, their product, in my experience so far has been less than satisfactory.","positive":0},{"review":"  The device is a false sense of security.  It does not regularly update to your phone but you won't know this until your item has gone missing.  Her purse was stolen and turns out the device has not updated her location in over a week.  So basically we are right where we would be without the money spent on the device.","positive":0},{"review":"  At the time I had purchased this, it said that the battery would last for one year and then you would need to replace the device. I lost my wallet and was able to pinpoint a general location of were it was, but the battery must have died before I could find it. Very disappointed that I only got half of what I paid for. The concept is good, and have had other good experiences being able to quickly find my keys, but the product should hold up to the claim.","positive":0},{"review":"  Amazing.  I have in suitcases and on keys.  Most airports I have noticed have a ton of Tile users so there is always someone nearby to help crowd find.  Will buy more.","positive":1},{"review":"  After losing not one but TWO sets of keys to my 2016 Subaru Legacy and spending more than $500 to get them reprogrammed, getting a key finder was critical.

It's brilliant.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great time saving device.  Found my phone with the call feature that calls the phone.  FInd my keys a lot.  This is one of those items that is a must have.","positive":1},{"review":"  I received a 4 pack of these for a birthday gift and absolutely love them. I'm headed to Italy in a few weeks and the joke now is that I'm going to be putting one of these in my boyfriends back packet so I can locate him when he wonders off while I am trying to shop.I purchased this single one as a gift for a coworker who is always losing his stuff. Affordable, works great and a fun gift.","positive":1},{"review":"  Best thing I have ever bought. Lost wallet. Love it..","positive":1},{"review":"  Love this. I have only used it a few times but it has worked well each time. I even found my wallet when it fell in between the bed and foot board. For anyone who just wants to make life a little easier and just gives you the comfort of knowing you will have help if you lose your keys wallet.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had the first generation of tile and I HATED it.

I would recommend this is as long as you do not have hearing challenges.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's exactly what I needed. I'm constantly forgetting where I put my wallet. I tend to forget where I put my keys and my purse too. Lol.","positive":1},{"review":"  The volume is very low. Its not great for finding lost RC stuff. You have to send each searcher a email which is not what I expected. You also have to walk VERY slow because if you are near the end of the range it takes quite a bit of time to register.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is terrible - has not worked a single time.

NO REAL TIME TRACKING. you can not find your items with this device unless you are close to them.","positive":0},{"review":"  Cool concept but the device is temperamental particularly when using the tile to find the phone. It often does not connect even though the phone is nearby and bluetooth enabled. Same issues on all. They need to improve the connectivity for this to be worthwhile.","positive":0},{"review":"  The tile app ALWAYS needs to be running, plus bluetooth and location. I usually use the \"close all apps\" on my android to stop from draining battery. It helps me find my keys though, so that's meh I guess. But I mostly wanted it to find my phone.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it. The best part is that it works in two ways: you can use the tile to find your phone, and you can use your phone to find your tile. My mom loses her phone more than she loses the tile, and sometimes it takes 4 to 5 tries to get it to work. Not sure why this happens but it's definitely a problem for when you're in a rush and can't find your phone.","positive":0},{"review":"  You must have app running at all times so if you close your apps it's useless. By leaving it running it drains your battery and your data. You can't change battery so after 10-12 months you have to buy a new one. Huge waste of money, returned it after a week of never using it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Worked well to find my keys howeverI thought this tile should have lasted longer than it did. Only about 15 month battery life.","positive":0},{"review":"  Doesn`t help to find car in large parking lot.  It would work right around the house to find things like your keys but I bought it because sometimes I forget where I parked. Sounds and the tile is not loud enough to be heard outside the car.

It's passed the return time so it won't let me do that here either. I want a refund or new one sent to me. It was supposed to last for a year and i don't even use it often to drain the battery that quick.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really like how I can have it at all times on my keys and another one in my wallet. I always seem to forget where I leave my keys and wallet but with the tile, I go to the app to activate the sound and within a minute I am able to find them. I wish the noise was a little louder for when I am at a loud place but besides that, it does the job.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this for my husband for Christmas 2015 and he has been using it for the last 6 months.  The tone it plays is loud enough to be heard from across the house which is great. Overall I would purchase this product again. It has definitely reduced the search time for lost keys.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works just like you would hope. And the fact that you can make as many cell phones you want into a trackable device is a great bonus. But 13 days later we did find him skin and bones. He keeps his tile on now.","positive":1},{"review":"  Best tracker I've tried so far. I LOVE that it doesn't have a separation alarm.The only reason I'm at 4 starts is because I have to leave the app open in the background, or I can't use the tracker to make my phone ring. However, there doesn't seem to be any battery drain from keeping it open.","positive":1},{"review":"  These were a life saver for me.  I lose my keys or wallet non stop and these have saved me from countless stressful situations.  So at $20 each you are basically renting them for $1.6 a month.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've already lost one Prius key, and they cost hundreds to replace.  A Tile on my key ring helps me keep track of it.  I bought the eight pack, to lower the individual price, and to give some as Christmas presents.  Sure do miss the Finder TV series.","positive":1},{"review":"  At first, the ring function from the Tile  to my phone wouldn`t ring.After Tech support from both Apple and Tile, it was determinedthat my model of Tile would not ring my phone and would only vibrate,but it would find what I attached to it.. my keys find my wallet and has work very effectively  everytime I needed it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Always love this little helper but then I haven't had a major loss to test the features of this tile. So far it's just been an easy finder. I bought this because we lost our car key when playing at Six Flags theme park but I still wonder if having this tile would have helped found it that night.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a key that I often lend out to people so they can access a shared storage room. Having a Tile attached makes it easy to see where the key is at all times, and even helps to remind people when they forget that they have borrowed the key.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the Tile. I'm always misplacing my keys and this has saved the day several times. I also love that if you press the 'e' on the Tile, it will ring your phone, even when it's on silent. My only complaint is that the app has to be open in the background for it to track the Tile's last location and no one is actually going to keep that app open all the time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got one for my keys and one for my wallet.  After testing it a bit, I decided to put it in the outside of pocket of my wallet so there was less surrounding if I had to look for it.. I am out $25 and hope people know this before buying.","positive":0},{"review":"  It kinda works, but the usability in finding your keys in an old house with walls one meter thick is rather limited.I like that it can make my phone ring even though I have my phone always on DND and rely on Pebble notifications.However, the Tile app is a stubborn power consumer according to most battery management applications and if you let your battery saver kill the Tile app on background you actually won't be able to make your phone ring and the last known location on the browser app will be the location of when the battery saver killed the phone app..","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought 8, 3 were for me to use personally, 2 didnt work, 1 worked fine, tried contacting help desk and after a week still no reply. Since the other 5 in my order were Christmas present and mine don't work I'm not giving them as presents. Waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Took forever to get this activated. Took longer to get it setup on my phone. Returned it because it was just too much of a hassle and worked less than 10% of the time. I have not tried another brand yet and don't know if I will.","positive":0},{"review":"  Usless on Android with 6.0 (Marshmallow)  Quit working after 2 months because my phone updated to 6. Also after receiving the tiles I found out that the battery lasts 1 year cannot be charged or replaced. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.","positive":0},{"review":"  The case came with 4 units. Just two of them worked for less than 2 months. Dont waist you money or time, is not worth it. The idea is great, so maybe in a future the product will be better.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this pack with the intention of tracking my mom and my sisters keys as they tend to lose them frequently around the house. Ironically I am now the one to lose my keys somewhere around the house after a trip away. Now here I am writing a review and I still can`t find my keys. Thanks for nothing Tile.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got Tiles to be use when I travel overseas in case some of my items were stolen. When I got to China and India I notice \"Zero\" Tile user around. Two of the three still have locations when I was in India when I am sitting 3 feet away with Bluetooth on. only one of the tile updated its location.","positive":0},{"review":"  I tried using this on my dog as a way to find her outside when she trots around the neighborhood.  Unfortunately it doesn't work at all for that as I always find her before it can find the tile.  Once my dog has trotted beside me for a minute or two, it registers, which does me no good.  I'm going to try it on my keys, hopefully it will be more useful like that.","positive":0},{"review":"  I didn't realize that you can't replace the battery in the tile and you have to send it in for a replacement at additional cost.  Only lasts for one year.  How cheapy is that.  Going back to Amazon.","positive":0},{"review":"  EDIT (FINAL REVISION 5 24 2019, AFTER OWNING LAPTOP FOR 2 MONTHS): I thought I was having battery drain issues, but it turned out to be my own mistake. Oops. Their customer service was FLAWLESSLY efficient and shipping came faster than expected. I can totally recommend this seller to anyone who is looking to buy from an excellent, reliable, top-quality source.","positive":1},{"review":"  I paid $244 for this laptop, and have had it since June 7th 2019.The laptop arrived with the promised specifications. However, I would highly recommend going with an SSD upgrade like the Crucial MX500. The BX500 works too if you are looking to save some cash, but it is not as highly speced as the MX series.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like how it was shipped, came with clear instructions, power cablebooted up well, got it authenticated 10 pro.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop is a great starter laptop, plenty of space for upgrades for future longevity.The refurb process could use with a quality control department, outer case shows normal wear and tear as to be expected with a refurb unit. However the unit was just plain dirty, crumbs etc on the keyboard and inside the case had to open it up and take a can of air to it upon arrival. You would think a company that does refurbishment could spring for a 5 dollar can of air or an air compressor to clean it out before shipping.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've left all reviews for reference. Here's the latest update: I contacted the seller about the battery (this took a while as Amazon was actually SUPER frustrating to help me), but once I was able to contact the seller they were SO helpful.First review: I'm stoked that I got this quality of lap top for the price I paid.  It works beautifully and the support from the seller on some questions I had was excellent.","positive":1},{"review":"  Typing this review from the laptop in question. Only bad things I could say about this laptop are that my fingerprint scanner was barely functional (no biggie for me, I like to use PIN numbers more anyway), and that the package came with someone's hair in it (kinda gross).  All and all, a pretty nice laptop for the price ($250).NOTE: I also had a bit of an issue at first with updating this laptop, though a few restarts solved that for me pretty well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I needed a laptop for school, but wanted to stay under a $300 budget. I found this online, but the reviews concerned me a little.This is a great laptop. I'm very happy with my purchase, and if I had to do it all over again, I would do no different.","positive":1},{"review":"  Looks and works like brand new. Price is reasonable. In any case, everything else about the computer is excellent, including the speed. If you have zero need for HDMI, I would definately recommend this machine.","positive":1},{"review":"  the PC it`s amazing, good and cheap, the battery is the only bad thing, doesn`t work.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was amazed at how clean this laptop was when it arrived, except for some barely noticeable wear on the buttons for the touch pad, it looked new. Screen, case, keyboard, everything, very nice. A terrific way to replace a windows 7 laptop that doesn't get alot of use or worked very hard. I work for an IT department that surpluses out our used desktops and laptops to non profits,  but they never look this good.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased through Amazon and laptop was advertised as 2018 model.  Upon opening the back, the battery says 2015 as does other components. I paid more for this for this reason as other vendors offered the same unit cheaper.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is listed as 2018 HP EliteBook \"thoroughly cleans the product. The products will have minimal to no signs of wear and no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away.The display also has a half inch screen burn in the bottom center that I can clearly see from three feet away.The computer is listed as 2018 HP EliteBook, but everything on the computer hardware and software states 2016.","positive":0},{"review":"  Description says 128gb SSD, but if you look SSD slot is empty. When you look at the 2. inaccurate misleading information on this offering.Now I've had this laptop for a few weeks, and here and there the mouse pad becomes unresponsive.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought it as a cheap laptop for my wife who wanted to write more, and upon booting it up I got a bunch of errors relating to disk images. What's more, I can't use Windows Update because it says \"Error encountered - We'll continue to check daily for newer updates. Usually things like this are provided as links to webpages to download helpful utilities, not the entire applications themselves.I'm considering sending it back because I shouldn't have to do this much work on what's supposed to be a reimaged laptop from scratch.","positive":0},{"review":"  The computer doesn`t go on at all, but I bought over a month ago as a gift. When the person received it, it did not work.","positive":0},{"review":"  THIS IS A USED COMPUTER. SECRETIVE FRAUDULENT AD. if they're lying like this you don't know what kind of computer you're getting. This is frustrating I returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop was not 'renewed'. it was dirty, beat up, scuffed, it looks like it was in a mechanic's shop, which, luckily for this seller, is exactly where it's going.THAT BEING SAID, it works. specs are as promised, i just don't know how they can use the word 'renewed' here.","positive":0},{"review":"  I know the risk of purchasing a refurbished item. All of the computers in my office and home are refurbished, generally open box items from Best Buy, and to date all have worked wonderfully.This was extremely disappointing. And disgusting.","positive":0},{"review":"  We bought two units. Arrived one day earlier than expected, but we unboxed them yesterday (thursday 08 22) because we were out of the country until then. I searched HP Support page and did all recommendations for problems similars to this but nothing make it work. I thougt that I needed to change the battery, but finally noticed that the it's charger was Dell charger (see attached picture) instead of HP, with apparently compatible plug but not able to charge the battery.","positive":0},{"review":"  So, this one, obscure function varies from one generation to another and it's never consistently stated or listed. I bought G2 because of the backlit keyboards before but apparently even the specific generation isn't a guarantee. Just be sure of the generation.Packaging was great, shipping was a breeze and hopefully the two new ones work as well as the other 8 I've deployed in various places.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is by no means a good laptop for gaming. It's meant for productivity.2 drive which is also very easy to access and only requires a screwdriver to install the drive. All in all I'm very pleased with this notebook and so far have zero buyers remorse.","positive":1},{"review":"  We were in the market for a new laptop for home use but didn`t need the $500 one and all of its bells and whistles. I failed to realize this laptop does not have an HDMI or SD card port. It`s small enough and lightweight. Thank you.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very clean, no scratches, reliable, powerfull and very fast computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop came as advertised. I open the box and it worked right away. The one bad thing is the track pad isn't always responsive. however, I use a wireless mouse so that is not at all a problem for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've seen a lot of mixed reviews on refurbished laptops like this one, so understandably I was a bit hesitant. That being said, the price point and specs made it hard to turn it down. It looks great, no cosmetic damage, and it came with a Windows 10 product key to run the program. All in all, I'm please with this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  We purchased 2 of these.  One for me and one for our 22 year old niece.  We both really need it for internet, word processing and photography processing the most.  Excellent value.","positive":1},{"review":"  i bought 2 of those, very good and very clean, setup was very fast. The first one was perfect. The second one had a minor problem with the cooling fan but after contacting Amazon and the seller replaced it right away, no more problem.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for an upgrade to my previous laptop (I`ve been told it`s a notebook at best). I needed an i5 processor for the games I like to play. The cord seems in good condition and I haven`t had any glaring problems or errors show up. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop is a great value for the price. Condition is excellentSet up is easy but you need wifi to do it completely.There are no Microsoft products loaded as advertised but an work around is using Google Drive which has a similar program to Word and Excel available.","positive":1},{"review":"  Computer works great so far.. when I inboxed the package, the laptop was nice and secured. The only bad part is the charger case was split and didn`t have the power chord with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The first laptop I received had a broken display port. I noticed right away because I use that feature frequently to connect to my TV. Thanks for the $15 credit Amazon. What a waste of time.","positive":0},{"review":"  Unit screen doesn't seem to respond to contrast function buttons. Emailed last Thursday regarding battery dying after 10 to 20 minutes. I understand what refurbished and have bought many a refurb products but the amount of issues with this unit would say strongly stay away from this seller. Not necessarily the unit as I don't have a fully functional one to give a review on.","positive":0},{"review":"  I needed a laptop just to take with me on deployment that had Wifi and Bluetooth.

I just returned it and will get something more reliable.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased a laptop from Walmart knowing that I was scheduled to be in the hospital for three months.  The computer went down and I had nothing.  I just got home and my 89 yrs old mother had an appointment and we tried to zoom and we saw and heard the doc but he couldn't see or hear us.  After I called HP for tech support to find there isn't a mic or camera on the computer, the very main thing I needed, I overlooked the refurbished part of the description.","positive":0},{"review":"  Came at a good price, but didn't expect it to be so heavy and bulky, considering it has a relatively recent manufacturing date (2014).","positive":0},{"review":"  Been buying refurbished desktops laptops from TekRefurbs for a couple of years and can't say enough about them.

Just as described and solid.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought the 13 sleeve for my 13 MacBook Pro (new USB-C version without Touch Bar), and it is a nice, snug fit, but not too snug. Make sure you pay attention to the size when buying for a 13 MacBook Pro. Other than that, it feels quality for the price, I`ve been using it for the last couple weeks and it`s protected my computer, although, I haven`t dropped my computer, and I don`t plan to purposely drop it to test how protective it is, hah. Also, the serenity blue looks like is has more of a lilac lavender tone to it, but in person, it`s more of a pretty light blue color, no lilac tone.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this case. I was desperately searching for a new case that would fit the laptop with a shell case on. The only downside is if you put your laptop charger in the front pocket, then it's really bulky so I wouldn't use it unless I need to put in my phone earphones or something small. Overall a great product and I would purchase it again.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great case. It's really compact, but not too tight to the point where it's a pain to remove the laptop. The padding around the laptop is also dense so I'm confident it would protect my valuables if I dropped it. I also like the additional little pouch on the outside which can hold the chargers, although then everything gets a little tight.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been looking for a case that was durable, waterproof, and wasnt too big for my laptop. I had originally bought this case in size 13-13. There is still a little bit of space so that the zipper is not restricted when the laptop is in, but theres ample space if i were to choose to have a hard case on the laptop as well. all in all, wonderful purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got the wood grain pattern for my 2015 Pro. It looks high quality and feels good to the touch, but only time will tell how good a product it actually is. Ultimately, if it keeps scratches and scuffs off your computer for a couple of years, it's overall worth the $20 bucks. I'll come back to update later if anything breaks off of it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The nice thing about MOSISO Laptop Sleeve Bags is that they come in a variety of sizes, so you have the opportunity to find the sleeve that fits your laptop perfectly.  The downside is that you are also likely to get a sleeve that almost fits your laptop but for the smallest of margins.  It will not fit a power adapter.  If you need to carry a power adapter in the bag with you, you need to find a bigger sleeve bag, which will no longer fit your laptop like a glove.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered the light grey 13\" sleeve for my 13\" MacBook Air 2020. I have a plastic snap on case on my laptop and it fit perfectly in the sleeve. I was super hesitant to buy it because of all the negative reviews regarding sizing but definitely know your laptop size because there are some that are 13.3 which then of course the 13 would be 'too snug' for.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered the 13\" sleeve in deep teal for my 2019 13\" MacBook Air.

Had high hopes, but I'm returning this sleeve.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have this laptop sleeve for my 2018 Macbook Pro 15\".Cons:The fabric alongside of the zipper has ripped, so the zipper usually gets stuck there. This is convenient when going through airport security, as it keeps my electronics together.All in all, this is a good case as long as your zipper fabric doesn't tear like mine did.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered this for my brand new iPad Pro.

That is why I came back to buy a second one for my MacBook Air.

EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. That`s on me. I`ve been busy with family emergency, but felt I needed to warn other computer owners.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really looking forward to this product to protect my computer, but when I opened the package, I could immediately see that it was creased and wrinkled around the edges. I'm not sure if this was how it was originally or if this happened during shipping, but regardless, I'm not very happy with how it looks. I would absolutely love this product if it weren't for this issue, especially because I really like the color, light purple, and otherwise it looks like it would be great at protecting my Mac, but this is too big of an issue to ignore. I'm definitely returning this product and may consider an exchange.","positive":0},{"review":"  I ordered the 13 inch sleeve for my 2017 13 inch MacBook Air and the sleeve wasn`t even wide enough to slide my computer in.

The sizing is off.","positive":0},{"review":"  I just received this sleeve today, and while it`s nice it`s not what`s advertised. It`s NOT vertical, which was annoying since I specifically purchased it to keep in a pocket in my backpack. If I can get it to fit into my backpack laptop pocket (which has plenty of room for my MacBook), I`ll still use it. This might be great for older models,  but it`s just ok bukly for the newer MacBooks, and most importantly it`s not vertical.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am nos sure if I received a used one as some type of permanent yellow stains were found on the plastic zipper handle (seems the yellow brown stains are in the plastic material).

For less than $30, it's comparable to some of the more expensive cases also sold here on Amazon.

I'm very satisfied with this case and I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this laptop sleeve to use for my new MacBook Pro 13in. After a few weeks after the purchase here are my initial thoughts. I may buy another for the kids iPads. Thanks for reading my review.","positive":1},{"review":"  Initial impressions upon receipt is it has a nice soft lining. Outer material seems nice. In my case, since it is such a snug fit, you really need to make sure it slides into place as you zip it or you probably could end up with scratches, especially as you go around the corners. I have found just being aware and pulling out on the corner of the sleeve as you are pulling out on the zipper to ensure that protective strip is between the zipper and the laptop and not pushed down to the sides of the laptop and it will just fall into place and your laptop shouldn't be exposed to the back of the zipper at all.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing fits my MacBook Pro, my charging cord, my magic mouse, and my adapters. Obviously the case looks a little bumpy with all those items in the front pouch, but I have no trouble closing any zipper. minus any scratches.I'm very satisfied with this case.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really love this little case. I can fit my laptop's charger in the outside pocket, and while it definitely bulges out, I can still close the zipper and everything. Honestly, it's just great for peace of mind, and I did accidentally get a little water on the case and it didn't soak through at all. Don't go spilling things on it, but if you get caught in some light-to-moderate rain, you should be fine.","positive":1},{"review":"  Feels nicer than my amazon basics laptop sleeve. Using a MacBook Air. It's also worth noting that I have a basic slim shell on both my MacBook and my tablet. Main pocket has soft interior but smaller pocket does not.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought the 13.3\" bag for my 2020 MacBook Air (Intel) based on what looked like the recommended size on this product page. I've had it for several months and use it at least a couple times per week, and it's held up well so far. There's a bit of padding in the bag to prevent dents and whatnot, and there's a small pocket on the outside if you want to carry something like your charge or extra cables in it.","positive":1},{"review":"  The case is a bit loose with a 16\" MacBook Pro, but it is snug enough that I will keep it and use it.It is padded well enough to be put in a backpack or other bag.I would probably buy another one of these.I would probably recommend this case to someone who generally looks after their things.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a review of the 15\" sleeve.Hardly fits the 2018 Lenovo X1 Extreme 15.79 x 10.24 inches (L x W x H)I bought this thinking the extra spacing in the size would be perfect but I ended being at the physical limits.","positive":1},{"review":"  Received this sleeve today and am really happy with it. The grey is a nice light color, the material is high quality, and the zippers are high quality as well.If you`re a student or a commuter, this is the perfect sleeve to give your laptop extra protection on your way to work or school. And it`s looks very professional.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this in July and the zipper already broke. Would not reccomend.","positive":0},{"review":"  My MacBook Pro, zipped tightly in this case, fell approximately four feet to the ground, and when I removed it from the case, I discovered that the corner of the laptop is now dented and chipped (on both the top and the bottom).  This seems like exactly the kind of small drop in which a case should protect from damage, and it failed.  Extremely disappointed.  Have communicated with Mosiso customer service, and they seem slow to respond and unhelpful so far.","positive":0},{"review":"  The bag looks exactly like the photos. 4 stars. I don't know that I fully trust it to hold expensive Macbook dongles. This is sufficient to keep your laptop from getting dusty or to add additional padding if your backpack doesn't have enough in its laptop compartment but I wouldn't trust this as the primary mode of protection for an expensive laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I chose the light pink color and immediately regretted it. I love the color but the first time I took it out for work travel it immediately got stained. If not, maybe scotch guard it before taking it out. Good luck keeping it clean.","positive":0},{"review":"  I`m sure this product would be a great source of protection from scratches and very stylish for traveling but I wouldn`t know because mine never left the box. As soon as it arrived I was super eager to use it for my brand new MacBook but much to my dismay, once unboxed, the laptop sleeve had some greasy chunks of what I could only guess was some kind of lubricant all over the clear package slip it came in. I took the sleeve out of the slip to find \u2018grease` stains on the fabric and a corroded substance on the zippers preventing me from even opening the sleeve. Not sure what when on in the manufacturing warehouse, but I am very disappointed to say the least.","positive":0},{"review":"  I dropped my Macbook Pro *in the sleeve* from maybe one and a half feet and the LEDs on one side of the screen all died. I had a Microsoft Surface Pro for 2 years with a Tomtoc sleeve and the few times I dropped it from a similar height there was absolutely no damage. It's only really protective of small scrapds or bumps along the top or bottom of the laptop. I'd only recommend this if you don't need much protection for your computer but just something thin so it's not rubbing against your other items.","positive":0},{"review":"  I just purchased one of these for my brand new 16 inch MacBook. I use it to carry my computer around in my backpack. My computer has a divot in the metal right where the zipper sits in the case where folded on the side. I would return but I'm past my return window, so I've ordered a different case to protect my MBP better.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great for my large Dell computer NOT great for my 13\" MacBook Pro. The product description said it would snuggly fit at 13\" MacBook Pro but was far too large. I haven't gotten the case wet so I cannot speak to the water repellency however, it stains very easily, pen parks, dirty outdoor table at Starbucks. Is prices inexpensively for a reason.","positive":0},{"review":"  Maybe I didn`t read into it enough but the product title is misleading saying it`s for 13 inch Mac book air.

Might be right for the 15\" version maybe. i do like the nubby fabric and the outer zipper section. It's padded but not too bulky, but it's just not a good fit.","positive":0},{"review":"  The overall quality is pretty good. It is padded and it is lined with a very soft and fluffy lining. I can still insert my iPad in but the pocket is a bit shorter than my iPad so I cannot zip it on. The only thing is that the product itself smells a bit, although the smell is not very strong.","positive":1},{"review":"  Update:I purchased the dark green one and it feels like great quality. Very durable. Sadly, I will be sending it back to purchase a different color and smaller size.I deducted one star because this is not the correct color.","positive":1},{"review":"  It seems odd to me that I would spend well over a thousand dollars on a new MacBook Pro and then scrimp on the accessories. That said, this is a handy and well-fitting sleeve that will do the job for any laptop lugger, perhaps ideal as a secondary carrier to a higher quality but bulkier bag or case. It's perfect for similar small accessories.I bought this mainly because there wasn't a great selection of sleeves for the not-super-new 13\" MacBook Pro (USB-C), and it will work just fine, but if I had a choice I would have invested an extra 20 bucks or so for one that feels more matched to the quality of my MacBook.","positive":1},{"review":"  This sleeve fits my Lenovo ThinkPad T460 very well. My laptop doesn't slide around inside the bag, and the sleeve fits inside my backpack fine. Time will tell if it will hold up well, but my initial impression is very good. If you have a ThinkPad T460 - this sleeve is a no-brainer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like that I could choose from so many colors. The material feels like it would be good for traveling and will hold up for a long time. My laptop is just an inch narrower than the sleeve which allows space for the cord in the outer pocket. If I were to change anything, I would ask that the outside pocket be just a bit looser to also accommodate a mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall I`m very happy with this laptop case for my MacBook Pro. I tend to throw my laptop into my purse and was concerned about accidental spills or dirt, so decided a small investment in a case was a good idea. It has a strong odor and it`s challenging to air it out the inside because it won`t turn inside out. Otherwise, I am satisfied with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I picked up this case to protect my new work laptop, and over the last 8 months it's held up very well (I haven't spilled anything on it, so I can't attest to how waterproof it is.) The main pocket is padded and lined with a plush fabric to give the laptop a little more cushioning. I honestly don't think I would have had this issue if my laptop was smaller, and not straining at the corners so much. When it comes time to replace this case, I'm going to see if this brand manufacturer makes one that's a little bigger.","positive":1},{"review":"  As noted by another reviewer, I checked inside dimensions and reluctantly ordered the 15 for my 16 MacBook Pro 2019 model.  Glad I did because t fits absolutely perfectly, like it was custom made.  Will keep from getting scratched & dinged during transport, but not likely to protect from harsh impact.  Zippers seem durable.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop sleeve is light and it fits my laptop perfectly.I searched for hours to find a sleeve that fits my Apple Macbook  A1707  15\" touch-bar 2017.

I like my things to fit snug but i got the 13. I returned it and got the 13\" and now the computer fits perfect just the way i like it but the charger barely fits in the front pocket. I like the 13\" i just wish it was a big wider to fit the charger not longer.","positive":1},{"review":"  It looks like they put a lot of effort into making a case that protects your laptop.  Interior is great.  Try going into a professional meeting with your laptop in case.  You definitely look less professional.","positive":0},{"review":"  It looks to be a well made laptop sleeve but the stated internal dimensions for the 14-15\" sleeve are actually smaller than described. What is listed here for internal is 14.0 and I can't zip the sleeve shut with the laptop in inside. It slightly protrudes from the top of the sleeve and the sides are pretty snug.","positive":0},{"review":"  too tight fitting, had to return it. however , they refunded my money quickly.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this to protect my 3:2 14\" laptop. The length of the laptop measurement was not adequate . While it fit inside the case (albeit snugly in the height direction), there was no corner protection left, which was kindve lacking in the first place. Top and bottom padding are fine, and the case otherwise looks great.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is about 3 inches too wide and 3 inches too tall for a 2020 MacBook Pro 13 inch. I didn`t think expect it to be this loose but it`s enough to bother me. Maybe I was sent one for the 16inch I am not sure but I am not too happy with this because the originals packaging was a thing g plastic bag that rips when trying to unstick the sealant.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was looking for a laptop cover that looked sleek, will provide a soft yet firm protection.  This looks and feels like it is made well, the quality is as it would be for the price.\" but it was a melon color, more orange-y, not my choice of color.  So the picture is nothing like what I got.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not sure how well it protects against bumps or falling but for as compact as it is, ite worth the trade. I wish it had just a little bit more room. By the time I get my surface, in, I have to really push to get the charging cord or anything else in the extra pocket. Other wise it is a great case.","positive":0},{"review":"  If you are looking for a case that will properly fit your laptop in order to protect it, BEWARE. The name of the product claims it is compatible with the 13 inch 2018 Macbook Air BUT IT IS WAY TOO BIG. If you want a case for your 13-inch Macbook Air, I suggest you find one that is 12 inches (the correct length of the 2018 Macbook Air) and look elsewhere. This case is also very bulky.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0The package came to me looking alright, no damges or dents on the box it came in, but when i opened the contents, the screen protector had two noticeable wrinkles, the top part of the cover had some scratches and the case that the laptop goes in has A LOT of visible wrinkles as if it was folded several times. It looked as if it was used or handled improperly. I am very unsatisfied with this.","positive":0},{"review":"  The sleeve itself is just fine. I ordered the green color and it was more like a olive green than I`d hoped.. and that size is too big.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought two of these and they fit a 13 inch MacBook Air perfect and I love the outside zip pocket that can hold a charger and accessories. BUT, like other reviews have shown, the material comes with all kinds of dents and creases in it. I bought the lime green and deep teal one`s and both came with the deep creases and dents. They`ll still work fine, but it`s annoying and why I knocked off a star.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my work laptop. I have a messenger bag that I love, but found that I wanted a simpler sleeve for when I was taking my laptop with me on the weekends. The zipper is well-made. I am very pleased, and have recommended it to co-workers.","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely wonderful protective case. I am able to fit my 13\" MacBook Pro (2015), in this sleeve with no issue. The soft interior is a plus. Arrived promptly - would recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this case as a stand-alone, quick trip case and love the outside pocket for my phone wallet.  The padding and protection is also great with a good fit.  The case is still rather new, so we'll see how it stands the test of time.  It is very affordable and functions well, so this one is a keeper.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product for my laptop (Asus Zenbook 15\").  Fits it perfectly.  I use it to hold my kindle.

I have a tumi backpack where the pocket is specifically sized to fit the 15 inch MacBook Pro but the other cases I tried were too large. Mosiso needs to advertise this sizing since it is not intuitive that this 14 inch case would be the right size. Also unfortunately, Amazon`s wild west marketplace makes it very difficult to find quality companies like mosiso when searching for laptop sleeves.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently got a new 13 MacBook Air and needed a sleeve to protect it so I opted for this one.

It`s affordable and well worth the money I promise.","positive":1},{"review":"  Baaaaaaarely fit my 15 Mac book pro. The zipper almost scratched the corners as I was Super dissatisfied as it also looked like it could hold my iPad too, but it was all just too tight.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is not the color you see online. And the material is not what I thought it would be. I wouldn't recommend this laptop case.

Disappointed by that, but it still gets the job done.","positive":0},{"review":"  There's something unmistakably cheap and tatty about this case in the flesh. It just feels and looks like, well, the price it is. The material is puffy and crinkly and budget.

Returning for a case that actually fits.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this for my MacBook Air 13\". Unfortunately this product already had minor seam unraveling when unpacking.

I can even leave the Apple Pencil attached if I slide the tablet into the sleeve with the pencil side down, which offers great protection from losing the pencil while transporting the tablet. All in all I am quite happy with my purchase, and feel it is well worth the price paid.","positive":1},{"review":"  As I recently purchased a MacBook Pro, the money I spent was too much to not take care of its physical appearances. For the price of $11 dollars, I was very amazed by the quality of the sleeve. Its not bulky and has a very nice style to it. Fits my backpack with ease.","positive":1},{"review":"  I honestly got it because of two things the color and the price point. I use it daily and for traveling. Great zipper no snags or stalls. It`s still a great value and so much less than what you would pay for in any store.","positive":1},{"review":"  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the pretty much useless zippered pocket.

I would purchase again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like the sleeve: it looks great on the outside, feels great on the inside, and the extra zip up pocket is really helpful for adapter I ordered with it. The only thing I would suggest is creating a special pocket for charger. I plan on carrying this around campus with me when I head off to college, so maybe a design that would fit the charger and minimize the usage of space would definitely be great, since I have to carry around books and papers in my backpack as well. But overall, great look.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've used this case for 1.5 years now and I loved every moment of it. Took away the 0.5 because of how easy it is to stain the case, but it's otherwise a fantastic purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was more of a fuchsia color than wine.

I'm kind of surprised by the high reviews, this isn't the worst bag ever but it offers no drop protection. This was my first time dropping it and I expected better but for the price you can't expect something to actually uphold the standards of the premium bags.This bag also stained pretty easily.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this as a birthday gift for my girlfriend.  On a thunderous rainy morning she put her macbook pro in this sleeve, which was also in another bag.  Only the top and bottom were water repellent as a result the water seeped into the sleeve. There's a very good chance this new $1800 laptop is damaged now, which is extremely frustrating.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this sleeve in February 2019 for my 13\" Macbook Air. It was exactly what I was looking for. BUT now, 8 months later, the zipper broke at the corners so it's useless. Maybe it was a lemon, but I'm disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Maybe it`s just me but it doesn`t firmly fit around my 2020 MacBook Pro. MacBook moves around way to much for my comfort.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a good product - cushy interior and perfect size for MacBook Pro.  However, after two or three uses, there were already strings loose near the zipper.  Annoying. I still have it and use it but not sure if the quality is as good as originally featured.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product was decent but runs on the larger size. It states 13in-13. My computer is a 13inch MacBook air and it was not properly protected with this size. I also seemed to lose over $10 in this transaction somehow.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've bought a number of laptop sleeves from Amazon, but this one was very flimsy. I didn't feel like it would protect my MacBook from the elements or from impact if dropped.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love this case so would of given a 5 star but I bought the red wine, red wine is one of my favorite colors so I know what it looks like this case is not red wine it is a very pinky red, not a fan but it is a pretty color if you want a deep pink. I wanted a deep red so super bummed out, guess I`ll keep it because I`d rather be protected then send back and pick another colors.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this sleeve because it offered the protection I needed for my laptop plus I wanted a sleeve that was water resistant just in case. Spilled water in my backpack today and this sleeve basically wicked the water in, my computer screen is now ruined and will cost me hundreds to repair. Don`t waste the money on this sleeve if you need emergency water protection, it doesn`t even slightly repel water. Would give zero stars if I could.","positive":0},{"review":"  When I got my order it was too big, and although I made sure i ordered the correct size, I thought that maybe I was sent the 15 inch by accident, so I set up a return and got the replacement in a day, before I was even able to drop off the original to the UPS store. They are both the exact same size. So while the product seems great, and the seller is super prompt, unfortunately the sizing is just off and it`s way too big for the MacBook Air 13.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a great sleeve - it's got cushion throughout, even in the corners. The inside is soft and doesn't pose a scratch risk (it's also hard for the zipper to contact the computer inside, again a boost.5\" front-to-back when placed in the sleeve. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it, but I am careful how I pick it up to avoid any sliding clanking accidental drops.","positive":1},{"review":"  This soft case sleeve is perfect for those who wants something simple, and doesnt break the bank. I have a MacBook Air 13in, my significant other has the MacBook Pro 13in...","positive":1},{"review":"  I have bought the 15-16 inches sleeve bag because under the description they say the model from my laptop was compatible. However, I got it and it fit but it was a bit bigger than I was expecting. I am just really happy with this purchase. btw, the model from my laptop is MacBook Pro A1398, so if you have the same model, a sleeve bag with a 14-15'' is going to be the perfect one for you.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was nervous about finding the right sleeve because the Surface Pro, while small a mighty, is vulnerable if not properly protected.  This Mosiso sleeve is the answer.  The front pocket, as with all similarly designed sleeves, isn't particularly roomy, but you can get a flat-ish mouse and the charging cords in there.  The cords are bulky and you might want to consider storing them apart from your device just in case.","positive":1},{"review":"  I originally bought the 15-16\" model for my new 16\" Macbook Pro because, well, the description said that's what it was for. That was false. Some laptop sleeves have this and it has two advantages: It prevents the laptop from falling out, even if the sleeve is unzipped (extra layer of security) and protects the laptop from the zipper scratching it. As of right now, I worry the zipper will scratch my aluminum while zipping it up.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I originally bought this in hopes that MAYBE I could slide my drawing tablet (Huion Kamvas Pro 16) in there. The tablet is 17. I really love the feel of the interior and the look of the exterior. So if anyone is looking for a sleeve for their Huion Kamvas Pro 16, this will not fit.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Black Mosiso Laptop Sleeve was a \"Perfect\" fit for my 13.3\" Mac Book Air. It's also never in the way because my Mac Book sits just right above it on the table. In its exterior zip pocket I only carry notepads and the mouse wire, at times the Mac books charging wire which also fits well even though it does place a noticeable bump on the sleeve.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's perfect for my 17\" Dell laptop.  It's nicely cushioned on the inside and I like the outside zippered pocket.  It seems sturdy and would provide good protection for my laptop.  The only criticism I have is that the outside pocket is stiff and doesn't expand much.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had a lot of trouble finding a case that fits the new Macbook Air (2019). This one is the closest fit that I have found. There is still a little too much (for me) room on top and sides, but not sloppy enough that it slides around.The canvas is nice and it doesn't smell like some other cases.","positive":1},{"review":"  Fits a 13 in dell latitude 7400 perfectly. Enough room in the pocket for the chargers, puck adapter and VGA to HDMI adapter in the front pocket with room to spare for a few more small items like a phone and charger. Wanted something small that would fit in my work bag so it was one less thing to carry. Can`t  speak to the water resistance as that has not been tested.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really liked this laptop sleeve until 5 months after using it, the zipper completely ripped apart.  I can still use it (with out zipping it) but have to be careful how i hold it so the laptop doesn't fall out. I'm bummed b c this looked like a relatively sturdy and durable case.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to protect my new MacBook in my backpack. I have a computer pouch in my backpack but I wanted to add a little extra protection. I suppose you get what you pay for. I just really want to like this case but that zipper kills me.","positive":0},{"review":"  There are two zippers on it, one of which busted off the seam within 6 months. I figured it was okay, and I could just use the other one to open and close the case, no big deal. Useless. Don't waste your money on this and invest in a better one.","positive":0},{"review":"  The zipper on this broke after using it two times. The laptop sleeve is decent but if it`s anything like the zipper pouch I`m sure it will break soon...","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this case for taking my computer to and from work. I carry it in my backpack but wanted some extra protection. The zipper started sticking within a month and shortly after the fabric started ripping along the zipper, so now the zipper is not functional. I liked the simplicity of this case, but will need to look for something higher quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  Mine came in dirty, seemed cheaply made and was not durable. The inside looked nicer than the outside and the light pink color was kind of harsh and cheap looking. I ended up sending it back right after I took it out of the package and never even used it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Everything was great on this product. The only thing that was upsetting is that when I opened my package my case was stained brown. Not sure if a worker had dirty hands but I bought the light grey color and it was stained with brown prints. Pretty upsetting.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love the laptop case overall. It is water protectant and very cushioned to prevent damage to the laptop. However, the case opens horizontally and not vertically as described. I enjoy the case and use it, but I would have liked a vertical case instead.","positive":0},{"review":"  Its too big for 13 inch tablet or laptop....","positive":0},{"review":"  The color was not really what was pictured. It was a lot more red than I expected, I wanted a more maroon, darker color. The case itself works fine, and does a good job protecting my laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love these cases. This is my 3rd one. That`s my hardest decision, choosing from all the pretty colors. This is my only go to cases for my electronics.","positive":1},{"review":"  Color is great, solid construction of the bag and with the zippers, the inner lining is that soft fleece material, which is amazing for the laptop. The pocket on the outside is big and can hold all my charging cords.9\".Overall, it's a great case for the money, you can't go wrong with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop case has lasted me through my whole college career. I bought this laptop case (gray color) in 2017- it is now 2020. Therefore, I have not experienced any damage to my laptop. Buy and try this case- it's good and it lasts.","positive":1},{"review":"  Case is okay, a bit big for my 13 inch MacBook Pro 2020 I got the 13-13`2 inch but I suggest if you have the same model MacBook to get the 13` in.","positive":1},{"review":"  Gonna be pretty blunt here:I like the case. Looks good, feels good, inside is nice and soft, and the design is slim. My two gripes with it is that there wasn`t an option to add a small handle, and the overall size could be a bit smaller and still fit the laptops well. If those two things were fixed, especially considering the price, this would be an easy 5 stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  Not sure about water resistance (haven`t tested) or durability (only just recently had it delivered) but the color is true, it fits my 13in Surface Laptop and it`s charging cable. I can fit my IPad in there as well and it`s just snug enough if I really wanted. Inside is nicely lined with soft fabric to keep the outside of my laptop safe and scratch free. Color is true to what`s online.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was just delivered this product today and was immediately impressed with its quality. The navy color was rich and even, the zippers worked well, and the padding seemed sturdy. Just consider buying a size larger than you think you`ll need so you can avoid making the mistake I made. .","positive":1},{"review":"  Cute and Protective This sleeve is perfect for my surface pro it`s different from the iPad in that the surface pro bins but you can slide it right out of the sleeve and set it up easily the color is very cute and it fits nicely without causing too much bulkiness in my work bag that I carry every day I really like it and there`s a pocket in the front thanks for this purchase on Amazon.","positive":1},{"review":"  I dropped the case a few times with my computer in it (by accident, of course) and nothing inside was damaged. The case is great and stains come out easily with just a wet paper towel. The little compartment is good for flatter things but not so much the bulky charger that my computer came with. The charger can fit but it's difficult to close the zipper - if I really need to bring the cord, I usually just leave the compartment open.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this case for my MacBook Air (A1932) for basic protection and for something to rest my laptop on while working. It is not as thick as other sleeves I`ve had in the past. It would be nice and more supportive if there was thicker padding there, but I recognize that this sleeve is more for protection against scrapes and dings, not against a drop. Overall, I`m happy with this product for its cost.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this because it was hard to find a laptop case that fits mine. It's not ideal, becasue the zipper is broken, but it gets the job done...","positive":0},{"review":"  Material looks really cheap for the mint blue one I ordered. ended up returning this one and getting one from ProCase that looks much nicer for only a couple dollars more.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was under the influence that this wouldn't take up as much space as it really did. My MacBook Air has a lot of space in there. I like the color and the inside however (very soft.) and without the damage and size issues I would say it's good quality for the price.","positive":0},{"review":"  While it did fit my laptop that was almost all that fit I couldn't fit my charger nor my charging cable in the little pocket and the case just makes my thin laptop super thick and more difficult to carry around.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am really disappointed with this purchase. I am used to my dell laptop sleeve that fits my laptop perfectly. My new mac book pro slides around inside and I almost dropped it due to all the extraness off the product fabric. The product itself seems quality but size down so you dont end up with a sleeve that is far too big.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this for my new Mac Pro 16 inch laptop. Unfortunately it was much too large for the computer and hung off about an additional 1 1 2 inches making it difficult to even put in my backpack. The quality seems decent, but the sizing listed on Amazon is inaccurate, at least when it came to this computer.","positive":0},{"review":"  The moment I took out of box and tried to unzip I had a hard times. The zipper wouldn`t move.  Went right back in the box.","positive":0},{"review":"  Received my item today and it came like this. What happened. How disappointing, I was really excited about this item. I will be returning it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very very low quality fabric. There is very little cushioning on the inside. This seems more like a packaging for a luxe case than something that is actually supposed to hold a laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  This did not work for my MacBook Air. It didn`t fit. too snug. I gave it to my grandson for his windows machine and it was great for him.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a full time student and my laptop has to go wherever I do. I have tried backpacks designed with laptop sleeves and they're just so bulky and heavy. According to the seller, the 13in sleeve would still work for me. Unfortunately it was too small and I had to exchange it for a size that was a little bigger.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered a MOSISO laptop sleeve for my new mac, and this one had all of the characteristics qualities that I was looking for, and there was a terrific color selection.. I can highly recommend this product if you are looking for a laptop sleeve that is high quality, provides superb protection, and also looks great..","positive":1},{"review":"  Laptop: Apple Macbook Pro 16 inchProduct: Navy Blue - 15-16 InchI love this sleeve for my laptop. The quality and durability feel great on the inside and out. I`m not sure if it was made this way, or I got the size wrong, but it fits great on the sides, it just moves around a bit in that extra space. I have not tested the waterproofing, nor have I traveled with it yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wasn't sure from the description if this would fit my son's new Chromebook so I gave it a shot after getting the dimensions for both. It fits snug which I think is perfect. Worked like a charm. Now let's hope he doesn't throw his backpack around.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this because I've broken my macbook before and don't want to go through that again. Its alright. The pocket on it is nice because you can hold extra cables and the main compartment has a nice lining that holds your computer.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love it so far. I've had it about a month or more. Love the side pocket to hold my stylus pen, usb, and screen cloth. Thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased the space gray version. Fits the 2019 MacBook Air perfectly. I use this to protect my air when transporting to and from the office and put my computer in it before putting it in my briefcase. You can`t go wrong with this case.","positive":1},{"review":"  this is such a cute laptop sleeve bag the inside is very soft and the outside is kinda rough and just the right amount  of thickness in case of a fall.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this product for months and it has held up tremendously. I have paid $70 for other cases in the past and they were not as good of quality as this case. Amazing value for price.","positive":1},{"review":"  .. I`m pointing that out cause I saw that other brands have re-enforced corners. To the durability I can`t really make a statement right now, time will tell.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is such a cheap looking product- yikes. I returned it immediately. Go with amazon basics for a similar product that is much higher quality and a similar price.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have a 13 in Mac book pro with Retina display. I bought a hard case and the reviews said the computer fit very snug and was sometimes hard to get in the 13in. Other than that the inside is very nice and it is a nice quality..","positive":0},{"review":"  The blue was not as pastel as I had hoped for. It was more of a bright, almost neon, blue. It came with a couple of creases wrinkles. The inside was nice and soft to protect the laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got this for a 15inch MacBook Pro 2018 A1990. There is a pretty big space between the top of sleeve  and computer. Definitely not shock resistant at all.  I am not rough at all with my computers however I don`t really think this is a safe alternative to more expensive cases with better perimeter padding.","positive":0},{"review":"  This fits my 13\" MBP-2014 edition like a shopping bag. way too big.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got the 15 bag but this photo shows my 2017 MacBook Pro inside, pushed into a corner. There`s over an inch of play on both sides.

I contacted amazon and they refunded my money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got this case with the front zipper broken.. Worth its price if it isn`t damaged..","positive":0},{"review":"  When it comes to functionality the product is good. Why I`m giving it 2 stars is because I was disappointed with the color. It`s very muted and faint and I was hoping for the yellow in the picture. Other than that it`s good.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this case for my new 2020 MacBook Air 13\", and the case is just a little too big. It's almost 2\" too wide and 1\" too long. My preference is for a case that fits my laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  \u00a0Hi. If you`re deciding whether or not to buy this product, buy it. The pocket of course still zips with my charger inside and could fit a lot of things, but I personally don`t like the bulky look and like my laptop sleeve to look as slim as possible and also it`s easier for me to carry it that way. So, no complaints about this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  Looking for a good looking protective sleeve for my new 2020 MacBook Air and this was just perfect. Fits with a little bit of extra room at the top. My biggest concern was if the sleeve would have an odor (chemical smell) which I have had in past sleeves  and I am glad to say there is no odor to speak of. Very happy with purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a really old laptop sleeve for my 13-inch Macbook that started to dry and flake up (10 years old). I needed a new one so I went to Target. But if you need a basic laptop sleeve to keep dust off and protect from minor dings, this is the sleeve for you. LOVE the extensive color options, too.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a nice sleeve to put my 13\" Macbook Pro in when I just want to carry it about for the day.  I've only used it a few times, so I can't comment on its durability.  I also used it to protect my laptop while carrying it in a larger bag.  Primarily it just offers protection against the laptop getting scratched up or having the lid accidentally open.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am leaving this review for MacBook Pro 2018 owners who are wondering which size laptop sleeve to buy. I have a 2018 MacBook Pro.6 inch sleeve is, predictably, a little too big for the 2018 MacBook Pro. I didn't measure exactly, but it's about an inch too wide and maybe something like 3 4 of an inch too long.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for a slim laptop sleeve that I can put inside a carryon tote when traveling. There is room to stuff in the cord and a few papers, but this sleeve won't serve as a laptop case. The only thing that kept me from rating it as a 5 is that the zipper tends to get caught in the light inside padding. Overall it's a good choice, especially for a MacBook Pro.","positive":1},{"review":"  i bought this for my macbook air (2019) and it fits perfectly.  the description and photos are very accurate.  incredible value.  i am quite impressed and very happy with my purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this for my MacBook Pro. It keeps it safe, and has protected it from a couple of drops out of my bag from hip-height. It looks nice, and seems very durable. The lining is soft, and a step up from basic neoprene.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great sleeve for my MacBook Pro '13. I have used this sleeve for a while and it has not failed on me yet. It doesn't slide inside the sleeve but rather there is a good amount of space to the top and bottom of the laptop. Would recommend to anyone considering a sleeve for their laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I got this, it was meant for my work computer which is a macbook air. I was very surprised by how vibrant and lovely the color was and also how smooth it was inside which was great for laptop protection. Moreover, it is super easy to clean and use as well as travel with (I would take it to work and home on the daily).","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought both the 13 & 13-13.3 to choose the correct size for the new MacBook Air 1932. However, I would have had to return the 13-13.3, even if it fit my laptop, because the larger zipper stuck at the point where it met the smaller zipper for the outside pocket.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good look and feel, definitely a quality product.The sizing is a bit misleading however.. but if your looking for a snug fit for a 13.","positive":0},{"review":"  My MacBook Air fits perfectly and the design is great. The quality is less convincing: After short while the zipper broke and after I spilled coffee over it I realized that is is non washable (according to care label) - probably because the lining is made of paper.","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is good quality overall, but slightly big for the new 2020 13in MacBook Pro. The computer shifts a lot. Finally, my product arrived with a grease stain on it which was disappointing. It`s functional, but i was disappointed upon opening and using the items.","positive":0},{"review":"  Way too big for the 2018 13inch MacBook Pro.","positive":0},{"review":"  Really cheap and tacky looking - returned it right away. Adding a lot of bulk to my AirBook.","positive":0},{"review":"  Got the 13 in one for my surface 4, it`s a bit too big. The material, color and durability are good but the extra room makes my backpack more crowded since im not using this case by itself. But they want $5.99 just to return it, even when i go to UPS or an Amazon locker which is ridiculous.","positive":0},{"review":"  Arrived badly \"chewed up\", after a couple weeks no change. Maybe good sleeve overall but wrinkled are not acceptable.","positive":0},{"review":"  My 13.3-inch was uncomfortably loose in this case, so much so that I gave up on using it. This case is marketed as being for Airs and Pros but is clearly designed with Pros in mind. It's a shame because I actually really like the appearance and feel of it.","positive":0},{"review":"  the zipper is missing on the outer pouch. so disappointing.","positive":0},{"review":"  LOVE THIS SLEEVE. The inside is sort of this cottony fabric, and the front pocket allows me to carry a external disk drive, 3 different types of wires, wired mouse, tablet pen aNd charger  with room left to spare and it`s not to tight, as for the main laptop pocket, it fit my 15.9in together and there is still room. So main pocket fits about 1-2 inches.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a good quality cover. I only dock 1 star because I bought the size for a 13-13.3, but it was too big, with about an inch + on each side. So I would recommend buying the 13 inch only size in that case, or checking the actual size measurements against your laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  The color is perfect for me and true to listing. It fits my Surface Pro 7 (and 6 before it) perfectly with the pen on the side so I don't have to worry about breaking the tip. However, I just got a Thule 13\" case designed for a MacBook which fits this sleeve inside perfectly since the surface is a much thinner product. Highly recommend that combo.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very nice case. It protects my new 2020 MacBook Air \ud83d\udcbb very well.3 inch pink case I thought it would be too big but nope it was just right. I would recommend this case.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great color. I loved the pocket on the back, but I just used it for a spare iPhone charger and a micro USB. If you need something more durable (aka for public transport commuters, travelers, journalists, etc.) I would get something else, but this does the job pretty well for taking it straight to and from work.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is perfect for my Lenovo Yoga 390 laptop. I can't really attest to the water resistance as I don't have it out in the rain and I haven't experienced any spills. Inside the laptop sleeve is enough room for a thin notebook or other paperwork in a folder. Great purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  This case is nice. I have no complaints about the quality or construction, so I'm giving it five stars. I was looking for something with a snug fit for my 13\" MacBook, and this case had a lot of room to spare. If you're looking for a snug fit for your MacBook, this is not the case for you.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was precisely what I was looking for. Love the color, love the fabric and feel. So I can actually use this for either laptop. I might even get a 2nd one at this price point.","positive":1},{"review":"  The material used is durable, and like that it comes in variety of colors. I have a Mac Air 13.3 and it fits perfectly a lil extra room to easily put in the laptop and remove the laptop from the bag. It also has another pocket to store the mouse, charger and the wire.","positive":1},{"review":"  So far I`m a fan of this case. It`s a great value and the color of it is vibrant and just like the picture. It keeps my Mac from getting banged around and I love the zipper pocket in the front for cables. I can`t speak to the durability or waterproof-ness, but as someone who doesn`t carry her laptop around much this works perfectly for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  The material seemed to be decent and protective, but it was just too large for the 13 inch macbook. There was at least an extra half inch of room around all sides, and I want a snug fit on my laptop, so I`m returning and ordering one from incase instead.","positive":0},{"review":"  The \"15-15.6\" DOES NOT FIT my 15\" MacBook Pro (2015 version). I guess the newer MacBooks are a little bigger. Do not buy if you have a true 15\" laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  Way too big despite it saying it was the correct size. I returned it and I'm gonna look for a different sleeve.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product name is misleading, my 2015 13\" MacBook Air doesn't fit and the zipper will damage your computer if you try to make it work.","positive":0},{"review":"  You get what you pay for. The case is extremely light-weight which is a plus, but the small case in front has a cheap plastic casing inside which makes a crinkling sound. The main holding place for your computer is soft and nice- I wish the smaller section had the same.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've purchased other zipper cases of a similar fashion that were nicely made and felt like good material. This feels cheap and looks cheap, and I'm returning it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Does not at all fit the latest Macbook Pro....","positive":0},{"review":"  I recently ordered this laptop sleeve after purchasing my 13` Mac. The product details said this sleeve was compatible for 13` Macs but this is not the case. My computer would not fit.

Have spilt anything on it thankfully so not sure about that aspect of the product. I do wish they would`ve added a handle for carrying around but that`s just me being picky. Good product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I just bought the 13.3 size, even tho my MacBook Pro 13\" could have fit in the next smaller size.  Cushy and protective, keeps my \"office\" all together.  I esp like the handsome deep teal color.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's padded but still very sleek. I absolutely love it, but one thing I would mention is that because its sleek, naturally, it doesn't have a lot of storage space. I only put my laptop and wireless mouse in this case. If you try to shove your charger in the front pocket its going to look really weird.","positive":1},{"review":"  Really great to have laptop cover that is padded yet not too thick. Also front pocket is convenient for storage. It`s a little big for a MacBook 13(fits perfectly but still room inside pouch) so I`m not sure if I should have went with the 13 instead of the 13-13.","positive":1},{"review":"  Fits the MacBook like a glove, and the lining is thick plush microfiber which was the main reason for buying.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a great laptop sleeve and the colors are really pretty. The only reason I gave it 4 5 is because it`s definitely too big for a 13 inch laptop like it advertises. There was at least an inch of extra room so my laptop slid around too much. I ended up buying a different one from another seller.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the color I bought and I love how soft it is inside to constantly protect my laptop. There's a side pocket and I fit my charger in it but it is a tight fit. I might have chosen to buy a larger one if I would have known.

Looks just like the picture. The zipper pouch in the front is nice too. The inside is a soft fuzzy material, the outside is not as soft as it is water proof.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ended up being too big for my 15inch. Bought it bc other reviews said the next size down was too small for a 15inch, but I had to return it. Decent value.

Of course the MacBook fits in it, that doesn't mean it is made for it. It is for a laptop 12-13\" and less than 1\" thick.

It can fit a 15 inch laptop.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have the new 13 MacBook Air. Unfortunately this case would be best for like a 15 laptop. I feel like my computer is quite loose and sloppy in this case. Not very impressed but hey it was cheap so whatever.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchased this sleeve for use on my MacBook.  Within 2 days of use, the zipper broke.  Not sure what else can be said about it.

It still sits on my desk looking pretty, though.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) with a thin hard-case. This sleeve fits perfectly. It does leave around half inch on top, but this is fine.

It easily fits my Surface pro 7, has a very soft inside lining, and has a small front pocket I fit a couple papers and wires in. It is thin like I said so I don`t think it`s going to protect your device if it falls from high heights or gets thrown somewhere but it is enough to keep it from getting scratched and easily pack it in a suitcase or backpack.

It fits my 2017 MacBook perfectly, like a glove. earbuds, ok. charger and cord, no).","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my Macbook pro 16\". Inside is of the sleeve is very cheap fabric.

Let's take a look at this radio.  I love this.  The size is perfect and versatility is fantastic.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Solar Crank NOAA Weather Radio for Emergencies works very well, and I love that there are different ways to power it up. You can hand crank it, use batteries, charge it with a cord, OR use solar power, which is excellent.

YMMV.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an emergency radio with built in light and power bank. It measures 5. And it`s great that you can charge your phone off the light is well. Overall, this is a very handy light radio, well thought out and easy to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  In just searching around I see this exact same item advertised under different names and at significantly different prices.  This review is specifically for the one priced at $30 and I feel like that`s very overpriced.  The reading light is convenient, though it`s not very adjustable.Pros:- multiple ways to charge the battery without mains power- ability to charge other devices with internal battery over USB- option to use AAA batteries instead of internal Li-Ion.","positive":1},{"review":"  I live in New England while we have pretty reliable power here, I'm also trying to be Mr. Prepared when it comes to storms and I've always wanted to try a crank radio. The one thing I wish this radio has (that other crank radios offer) is SW (shortwave)--so keep that in mind if you SW matters to you. Overall I'm pretty pleased and find myself messing with this thing a lot in front of the TV and I'm always psyched to hear that NOAH broadcast, but again, sitting hear a window helps and aiming the radio in the right direction is a big help.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everyone should have an NOAA radio as part of their emergency supplies. After all, everything that we've come to rely on to give us news and weather info could quickly become non-operational during a serious enough storm or other disaster.A decent value for your home emergency supplies and or your bug out bag.

If I am caught in a jam, I will be so glad to have this with me. By the way, at this price point, it is an outstanding value.","positive":1},{"review":"  Was really surprised at how small and compact this emergency radio is.

I live in California and you never know when an emergency will arise.  Awesome radio.","positive":1},{"review":"  It can never hurt to be too prepared and this serves as a good compact and lightweight radio and flashlight. I like all the options you have to power it.

The rechargeable battery charges very quickly. The radio tuning knob is a bit sticky, and the sound isn't great, but you don't use a tool like this to listen to music. It's for emergencies, and would function very well during one.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is not the first emergency radio that I've owned but it's probably the poorest performer.  I like the features but the radio leaves a lot to be desired.  The reason I got this radio is to listen to emergency broadcast information but it seems unlikely that I'll be able to do that.  Not recommended.","positive":0},{"review":"  I live in Southern Louisiana, hurricane central. After living through the nightmare that was Hurricane Katrina, I will NEVER be without a product like this Solar Crank NOAA Weather Radio.

The multiple charging approaches - wind up, USB, AAA battery - provides choice for almost any scenario. Smaller than expected, and lighter. A good choice.","positive":1},{"review":"  Small and light weight enough for a cargo pocket it but large enough that you'll notice if it the thing falls out of a pocket or backpack. Besides the solar charger, the hand crank will give you a good power charge with the internal lithium Ion batteries and I particular like that you can switch between the internal battery and three triple batteries so you don't end up burning one or the other out. The radio bands come in loud and clear with no issues between AM, FM and weather band. The siren on it can be adjusted to.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm rather pleased with the Solar Crank NOAA Weather Radio for Emergency with AM FM, Portable Radio with 2000mAh Power Bank, Flashlight, Reading Lamp and SOS Alarm.

I had developed a painful shoulder, neck and back which require therapy from leaning over in an unnatural position.

(I would suggest that you write down the multiple degree settings once you find your comfortable position to make that comfortable position(s) easy to replicate.","positive":1},{"review":"  First off, let me start by saying I rarely give anything a 5-star rating. There always one thing that could be improved and this only has one that I've discovered.I have not replaced the unit because I no longer sit in bed as much as I used to for work. Maybe for the right price, I would consider getting another one, but I will have to be a little more careful with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was looking for something to help raise my laptop to not hunch over it but also to have something tall enough to use standing up (REALLY recommended to do this once in a while, a lot less back pain).It folds well at the angles, clicks in place, has markings to help you remember settings when moving it elsewhere, you just have to remember to do things in the right order and match both legs to get it stable. It's relatively light but doesn't feel cheap.Been working great, I'd buy another if this one ever gives up as it was a good price and good quality.","positive":1},{"review":"  This stand lasted 3 1 2 years before one of the leg joints completely broke. What I liked about the stand is that it keeps the laptop running cool and has a fairly low profile. I do feel like I got my money's worth from the 3.5 years of use though.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this thing.  This is the solution I have been waiting for.  If you go it on your own just realize that it's easy to create a configuration that is either forward or backward unstable (top heavy) and make sure you keep the tray centered over the portion that rests on the desk or table.I keep the tray horizontal for working on my laptop, but it only takes a few seconds to tilt it upward for reading a book, newspaper, tablet, &c.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been hoping for such a product for many years, so I was grateful to find one that has so many great features. I can be really difficult to satisfy, yet I have trouble thinking of any features that the designer did not include. On the other hand, I wouldn't fear tipping if I didn't have a tendency to roll around while sleeping, so why would I want to strap myself in like that. Clearly I have some inconsistent desires here.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am pretty happy with this purchase. I really appreciate the color. You do have to clear it off to reconfigure it. It collapses nice and flat to stow away or take with you.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this just under a year ago from the advice of some random person who recommended it as a standing desk on Hacker News. It was slightly impulsive, as I immediately regretted the decision based on the price since there are dozens of cheaper models from different manufacturers around, but figured I'd give it a shot anyways. I've not ever used it in bed, as the description seems to indicate it can be used for, so I can't provide any insight there. However, if you're thinking about a laptop stand in this style to raise your desk to standing level, I would not hesitate in purchasing this stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this tray and especially the rubber guard at the bottom where the computer rests. I have a 17 inch computer and together both can be somewhat heavy so I take precautions to move them separately if a moving across the room.  It's  sturdy, functional for my needs and attractive. Overall, it meets my needs and I recommend it with precautions as stated.","positive":1},{"review":"  To start with, the website description '100% Aluminum Alloy Composition ' is inaccurate, it has at least  all joints made of plastic, every time I put my 15\" Pro on this the legs spread a bit and it certainly doesn't feel sturdy while using the keyboard for typing. It may be ok for very mild use like watching videos ( so u are not touching the laptop non the stand again)  or for other uses. Not for someone who wants to work on for couple of hours.I bought this due to misleading website description, not worth the money.","positive":0},{"review":"  I, like many, use my laptop while on the sofa etc. I can never get comfy and working on my lap ultimately hurts my wrists.So right now it is decorating the floor as I find it to much of a pain to use. I'll probably keep trying but this is not the laptop stand for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  I spent time searching on Amazon for a tray table to use on the couch and bed.  I thought the apparent flexibility adjustability of this would work well.  It's still a bit of a project to change it around though perhaps that will change as I get more accustomed to it.  It might be the best choice if you envision a variety of users or using it in different places, but I think I would have been happier with a less adjustable one if I could have been more sure it would be the proper height.","positive":0},{"review":"  Well, It's okay..Another concern is this notice:\"This product is made fro, aluminum alloy.  Avoid using it under long time high temperature or low temperature environment to protect your skin.","positive":0},{"review":"  While this stand ultimately does the job, it's really not easy to adjust. The problem is that you can't make subtle adjustments to the height angles while the stand is actually functioning because as soon as you adjust one angle the structural integrity is lost and the whole thing collapses on you (yes, I've learned that the hard way). Once the thing is actually in the position you want it in, it's great. But every time I have to change positions and adjust the stand, my heart sinks a little.","positive":0},{"review":"  I hate this thing.  I had high hopes based on reviews., watch a show on computer in bed, then use to write emails or use on desk, etc.  Returning it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I recently bought this laptop stand during a Gold Box deal and was a bit disappointed when it arrived. Adjusting the tray can be a bit of a hassle as each pivot point requires individual turning. The stand is plenty wide, just not deep enough to accommodate my laptop (which isn't even particularly large). Overall I'm not exactly unhappy that I paid $40 for the tray, but I would not pay more than that otherwise having now used it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very difficult to set up so it's just right, and when it is to my liking it does not feel like it holds my laptop securely nor on any other setting. The stand could not stand properly on my couch nor bed. The price point seemed a bit high when buying the product which made me believe that it would be a better quality stand but I was sadly mistaken.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was really looking forward to this thing. They have a couple at the office and I was excited to use this to stand up at my desk at home. Sometimes even with the feet set to 90 degrees, I can tell all the weight balance is right above the leg, and the ends of the feet are kind of sticking up.Overall, it does what I wanted, but very poorly.","positive":0},{"review":"  Independent positions are very hard to set. The balance depends on each and every adjustment being perfectly right, perfectly correspondent with the other \"leg\" at each and every joint.Very good idea, excellent construction, and attractive design. I regret having to return it on account of its practical flaws.","positive":0},{"review":"  This laptop stand can be used in bed, on a lay-out couch, as a mini-podium to turn a low table into a standing desk, or just folded up to angle your keyboard up and raise up the screen a few inches. I switch between all of the above on a regular basis.Get this stand. There's so many things you could do with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  UPDATE: Well, I wished I'd bought two in my original review.. experiment.Note: I didn't get the mouse pad attachment b c I prefer having the mouse pad on the bed.","positive":1},{"review":"  This works for the purpose I wanted, and it did immediately. :) You will laugh, but I wanted something that let me work on the computer while the cat sat on my lap. The laptop went up, and she got under it. She seems to like the cave-like feeling that the desk makes at 90 degree angles.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently converted to a laptop gamer from being a desktop gamer.  Until I found this item my setup consisted of sitting my laptop on a pillow on top of my lap while I sat on the couch.  It is right at the level that I can play while sitting on my couch and pull it forward closer to me.  It is so much better than my old lap pillow system and I am very glad that I purchased it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am absolutely OBSESSED with this product. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. And the \"flimsiness\" of the material makes it super super light. Could not be happier with this versatile product - a must-have.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have to admit, I chose it because it's purple.It's a great stand, it does as it states and feels very secure and sturdy when I am rest in my arms on it for typing. Not a huge deal but it's just a little tedious. If your intension is to leave it in one position all the time then it's superb.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have been using this as a stand-up desk at home and I really like that it's fully adjustable (remove laptop first).  I find that I get to my work more quickly since I'm not trying to get comfortable in a chair and it's in a place that I walk past frequently, so I can multi-task much more often.  I couldn't resist the purple ..","positive":1},{"review":"  This has made reading so much easier in bed and to hold papers in my chair.  It hold my iPad, phone, magazines and books very easily and makes reading much more comfortable in bed.  It is also a little wider than I would prefer.  I think if it was 2-3\" narrower, I would like it better, but too much and it would be difficult to straddle the hips.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was studying for the Bar Exam and had thousands upon thousands of pages with tiny print to absorb and it was taking a toll on my shoulders and neck. I ended up doing a major internet search and finally ended up deciding on this table stand and I am so glad that I did because it worked perfectly. It's very sturdy and very light as well. EXCELLENT.","positive":1},{"review":"  Now that I've had this product a couple of weeks, I LOVE IT. It takes a minute to get use to adjusting the legs and tray but once you get use to it, you can adjust quicker. Be patient when you get this. It will seem awkward in the beginning but once you get the hang of it, you'll find it a very functional and useful.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had modest hopes and was still a little disappointed. The legs have positive stops, which is helpful but it's not easy to position the legs and table evenly.If you want to sit upright and type in a bed, it could be useful. If you need to tilt you laptop past 20 degrees or so, this product won't help you.","positive":0},{"review":"  I guess it's OK. Kind of fun, pretty for sure.g. work in a standing position, this is not the right product.","positive":0},{"review":"  I haven't used this much since I got it. Maybe it would work better in bed. Just, when you hit a key it sort of bounces a little. Maybe I'll get used to it.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is very versatile. Adjusting the three sections on each side can feel quite awkward. I have the pieces but I can't seem to get them to go back together. So I'm chucking it for another.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really liked this product. The flexibility was great. FANTASTIC customer service.

Hated it...","positive":0},{"review":"  This is best used in ONE location, as readjusting it every place I used my laptop took much too long. I am still looking for a great adjustable stand, but this one was too fussy. each side has to be adjusted EXACTLY the same degree, and there are THREE adjustment knobs per side. It got too cumbersome after a few days, I returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is easy to adjust.  But, not as sturdy.  I did not want to put a regular computer (as oppose to a small light one) on it.  So I use it for other purpose.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've had this for several months. Its well made but WAY too complicated. If you like a puzzle, by all means buy this thing. If you just want an easy peasy way to not have your neck hurt while working on your computer-AVOID.","positive":0},{"review":"  I purchases this to enable me to work standing, when I need to, a job which is does satisfy.It is a little hard to get it adjusted to the right position on both sides, but once you figure out how it works it is good.It supports my laptop perfectly and is a great addition on those days when I want or need to stand.Better yet, compared to the cost of a standing desk, it was a steal.","positive":0},{"review":"  The Furinno Adjustable Vented Laptop Table is wonderful. So easy to configure, just match up the click lines. I still don't use it very much in a prone position much. For sitting on the couch to work and watch tv it is simply awesome.","positive":1},{"review":"  Oh my goodness, this little piece of laptop joy is incredible.  I had my doubts when I saw it, and it took me a few minutes to get it set up for my favorite chair at home -- but once I did, I am in love.  And you can even use it in bed to watch a movie on your screen.  Where has this been all my laptop life.","positive":1},{"review":"  This vented laptop table bed tray definitely takes getting use to - if you just slow down and use the instructional booklet which shows almost every possible variation and the helpful settings, you will probably enjoy the use of this product.  We initially had issues with it but once we simply reversed the settings WE thought were good, to that of what the manual suggested (reversing bottom leg's direction) it worked out well.) we can easily set it up for quick use without having to experiment.Bottom line, 4 stars overall, if the edges were buffed out a little and it was a tad sturdier, I'd definitely give it 5 stars.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently had neck surgery and just holding my iPad to read caused so much discomfort to my shoulders and because of my neck brace I couldn't prop it up on something because I couldn't look down.Needless to say, I went in search of something that could make my life easier so that I wasn't bored out of my mind during my resting period and came across the portable bed tray.  I like that it specifies the degrees of angles and it also came with a pamphlet with sample angles for different positions, which I found very helpful.If you are thinking about purchasing a laptop table, I would go with this one hands down.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this computer stand. I use it almost every day in so many locations. Great gift for someone who works a lot on laptops and is always hunching over to see their screen.  With this sleek stand, end the hunching.","positive":1},{"review":"  Although it took a few tries to get in the groove of changing the height, I love this product. It adjusts so that I can put my iPad on it while laying in bed or sitting in a chair and with a few small snaps I can put my laptop on it at just the right angle. I can put it on my island to work on a craft and it is raised at a perfect height to see everything I need to see up close. So happy with this item.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this pretty well, but it is shorter than I expected. When in position as keyboard stand with \"feet\" it is only about 2.  I've added some photos showing some of the positions it can be configured into.  One photo is a little small, but shows a greater variety - they are from the manufacturer's instructions.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this to get me through some post-surgery. I will be using it a lot longer than that.The front is padded so resting your arms wrists on it is quite comfortable. Highly recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  I wasn't sure about this when it came in, but after using it for awhile I love it.  My biggest complaint is that the width just happens to exactly match the width of the couch cushion, so the legs want to disappear between the cushions if I don't position them just so.Feels like it will last a long time.  I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an absolutely brilliantly executed product. It is a perfect fit for an HP Envy 15\", and then I recently got an HP Envy 17\", which fits, but hangs off the back a bit (it's quite secure, just know that your 17\" might be deeper than the stand). Don't hesitate, I've been using this since the first time they came on Amazon (I'm guessing at least 3 years now, maybe longer) and it still works perfectly. I have a second one that I use in bed to get my iPad up to my line of sight.","positive":1},{"review":"  this product came promptly.It is of a good quality --folds and opens nicely.I was expecting a free standing portable computer bed desk but this one is not the type unfortunately.

I would recommend not ordering this item. The concept is good but the plastic hinges need to be rethought.","positive":0},{"review":"  cool tool -sturdy, lightweight, easy to adjust.  however the depth of the item is supposed to be 11.5 inches.  my computer has an 11 inch depth so this didn't work for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  ok here it is, I do love it for it's purpose, but adjusting it to fit the size you want was so frustrating, it's not that easy and i found myself wrestling it.. so i keep it at my desk and avoid adjusting and re-adjusting because it was not an easy task.Other than that, i love its purpose and color.","positive":0},{"review":"  Good concept, poor execution. A total pain when making adjustments.Will buy another. just not this make and model.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm not really sure about this thing yet.

I preferred it instead of the wooden ones because of the advertised flexibility and adjust-ability...","positive":0},{"review":"  The product is as they say just okay.I found it impossible to to get all the six adjustment settings done easily.I was looking for something easy to use and then fold away, and this is not the product for that.It is sturdy and once adjusted worked well.","positive":0},{"review":"  Takes a lot to adjust as you have to push buttons on both sides at each joint. so as long as you keep it in the position you like it`s not too bad. But I found it too high-maintinence even for the flexibility it offered.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great positioning. It's lightweight but that can cause it to topple easily. If you don't want weight at all, this is ideal. The rubber lip holds my mini iPad perfectly, unless balance is transferred such as a mattress.","positive":0},{"review":"  I do a lot of late night work on my laptop and iPad as well as watch Netflix and Amazon Prime Movies on both devices.  This vented table is a handy device to have.  Next go round, Furinno should consider either larger numbers or tactile knobs, sort of braille-like to be able to make adjustments without turning the whole thing upside down and all around to get it right.  Nice quality of materials and overall an elegantly designed tool.","positive":1},{"review":"  I watch a lot of movies on my laptop while laying in bed. Especially recently due to being down from surgery etc. My only complaint is I wish the green had been available. I love the pink it's very pretty but green is my favorite color and I would have preferred it over pink.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this because I work at a computer all day and wanted a way to stand while working.

I wish I had like three of these in college to keep all my books and notes on.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great little laptop accessory. Works nicely and looks cute too. I agree that adjustment isn't as easy as it could be. But it's not difficult, you just have to take your laptop off the table first.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pros: super lightweight, you could probably travel with the thing. Easy to set up. I don't plan to travel with this, but frankly you could and it would even fit in a carry on suitcase because it folds down very flat. Good value.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a chronic illness that can keep me in bed for months with only my laptop for entertainment. For the past few years, I used my breakfast tray or a lapdesk both were uncomfortable for long term use, especially for my legs since I had to stay in a lock-kneed position for both tools (I tried propping pillows under my knees but it still cuts off circulation). Luckily, I don't need to change settings because when you are weak, tired, and your fingers hurt, it is very difficult. But it is worth the mobility I regain and knowing that it is solidly constructed.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this to hold my iPad Pro..because I mainly sketch on the iPad pro. Goodluck to you in getting your workspace comfortable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I would have given it 5 stars, but there is one issue, it's a bit hard to get the right angles, it takes some time to play with it to get it just right. Other than that, it's a great laptop stand.  And I love the color purple, so I ordered the purple.  I'm glad they have it in many colors.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love the flexibility this gives me.  I have it sitting in the middle drawer of my desk, which puts the laptop at a more ergonomic position while sitting.  It's kind of hard to use it while standing, so I resort to the touch pad.  I understand one can buy a special attachment for this, so I may look into it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a handy piece of gear to have. Multiple points of articulation make this table adaptable to a wide variety of situations. And as others have noted, depending on the way you use it the table can be a bit tipsy, so keep a hand (or a knee or a pillow or whatever) in place to brace it. Overall though, this is a very useful item.","positive":1},{"review":"  Legs don't extend evenly.  Tossed it a month after purchase.  Never again.","positive":0},{"review":"  I was excited to receive this item that I thought would be perfect for my SurfacePro tablet PC and school text books, for either tabletop or lap use.Well.

Hinge points arrived very very loose (too much play), sounds like a squeaky machine, I barely trusted my laptop on it, let alone put any weight from my wrists arms on it to write. AND you need an engineering degree to follow the positions   arrangements they provide.","positive":0},{"review":"  Lightweight, does the trick but, is totally annoying to position. It is very difficult to adjust. If you only want to adjust it once like I did great job done, however if you will be using it to move from place to place I would purchase with caution. Did not seem to be much else out there to purchase so I suggest the product with the understanding that it is hard to adjust.","positive":0},{"review":"  So I saw something like this on FB, but just not this cool. I shopped around Amazon for awhile before deciding on this one and WE love it...","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this thing. I'm a feild nurse and I had my brother cut it down a bit to fit in my bag. Perfect for when you are charting on a tablet or small laptop. The only con is that it is a little clumsy to open up and as a tall person I wish it was higher but the fact that it is light and folds small enough to fit in my bag.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just got this a few days ago and love it.  I use it in either of my recliners with no problem.  Purchased it from one of the optional sellers\u2014100% satisfied. Thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does what it's supposed to do. It helps when I plan to be on the computer for awhile. I don't bother if I'm not going to be using it for long.

I am quite happy I bought it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Terrifically happy with this stand. It works well as a bed lap stand or as a stand on a table, and I use it with an iPad as well as with a laptop. The instruction sheet shows you a number of configurations that are SAFE and gives exact angle settings for the joints. The people here who have said they positioned it in ways that would allow it to tip over or that would allow an iPad to fall off need to think ahead before they set it up.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been using this mostly as a makeshift stand-up desk. At work I just set it up on the cubicle table. I can definitely say I need one of those anti-fatigue mats to stand on. I don't have a good one to recommend yet.","positive":1},{"review":"  After having fusion surgery on my neck, I needed something that would hold my tablet, book or kindle at a higher level as I cannot bend my head down to read as before. This stand has worked very well for this purpose. I do not have a laptop, but it appears it would work well for it too. I am very happy with it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I would not have bought this if it had not been on sale for half price. I'm glad I did. I don't think I'd pay the full asking price because it's obviously overpriced (how could I have bought it at half-price if they weren't still making money on it).  But I do believe it to be the best one available on Amazon.","positive":1},{"review":"  I get a lot of use out of this lap desk. I originally bought it when I was preparing to have surgery and needed to work without my laptop actually sitting on my lap. Overall, a great lap desk, though.

Today, though, was the last straw - I don't know how this happened because I was being very careful with it but when I rested an elbow on one side of it, there was a huge cracking sound and one of the legs broke right off.

So if I order it again, I would have to pay full price.I haven't decided yet if I will send it back, because I like the stand, as flimsy as it is (it wiggles quite a lot from side to side with my laptop on it), and I'm afraid a replacement will have other flaws, like the stuck push buttons mentioned in other reviews.

Two issues, though it should be said that I know of no other such stand that is any better in these regards:1.  There should be some sort of grippy material on the bottom(I mounted some ISC 3500 Jessup Safety Track tape to it)2.  I worry about the durability of the stand, especially if it's rested folded and standing up on one of the leg sides.","positive":1},{"review":"  We got two of these for the office for people to use working while standing. We raised their desks somewhat and then moved the stand rather high (but not all the way). The cool thing is that there are indicators for marking the degrees of angles.

Although it's a great idea, it was really awkward to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  This lap desk is terrific.  The variety of height adjustments available is terrific.  It would be nice if there was some way you could adjust both sides at the same time - it's six adjustments at set-up and break-down, but if I am on the laptop for more than fifteen minutes or so, it is worth it.  Would definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is almost infinitely adjustable.  Adjustment is a bit cumbersome, getting each side in the same angle at each joint.  If you are going to have to reset it a lot, you might get quicker at it with practice.  Ours arrived with a dented leg, but it does not affect the operation of the unit and cosmetics is not an issue, so we just kept it as-is.","positive":1},{"review":"  Kinda cheap and the lip could be tweaked to better keep some things from falling off when being adjusted moved.  Sides will be very close to your sides as well. This was purchased for someone pregnant who doesn't really use it anymore so the appeal doesn't last either which I believe if made better it would have been used way more.","positive":1},{"review":"  I work from home a lot and noticed that I was doing too much sitting. I can adjust this to a perfect height so I can also stand for part of my day. It's very stable and the vents in the bottom do a great job of keeping my laptop cool.

So I'm stuck setting this stand at an upward angle instead, which I don't really like. Otherwise everything is as advertised, and it's a pretty nice stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  As a vented laptop table, this is very effective, sturdy, and thoroughly adjustable for a range of heights. It's useful for all sorts of things other than laptops as well.

There are so many configurations that you can choose for it. I buy it again. Oh, and it's really light weight.","positive":1},{"review":"  These Furinnos are amazing stands, they look like they'd topple but they're surprisingly sturdy and work both for making a sitting desk into a standing desk and for allowing viewing of a laptop as a TV when we're traveling.We use this with a old 17\" MacBook Pro and it supports the 15\" just fine as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for my wife.

Hard to set-up and won't hold still on bed.","positive":0},{"review":"  For this price, I expect something that is solid.  Instead, with every keypress the entire platform shakes substantially.

I was hoping for something more ergonomic that I could use with a kneeling chair.","positive":0},{"review":"  The joints were made out of plastic. One of the plastic joints was fractured after light uses.","positive":0},{"review":"  This table was much shorter than I was expecting. It may have been me reading the height incorrectly but it is very short at the tallest extension and so I couldn't use it.

A smaller tray might be more portable.","positive":1},{"review":"  One year later, it's my go-to desk around the house, when I want to get out of the regular desk chair.This is much healthier than setting the laptop on your lap where your body absorbs the radiation. Also better for your back and neck due to the many positions it can adjust to.","positive":1},{"review":"  I mostly use my laptop while sitting in bed while watching TV.  I was so tired of trying to balance the laptop on my legs while typing.  It allows the laptop to stay cool due to the vents and you can adjust this multiple ways.  Great idea and I shopped for the best price but I still felt it was a little overpriced.","positive":1},{"review":"  After knee surgery I spent a lot of time lying back in bed using a CPM machine.

It's a bit more surface area than my last laptop desk but it makes for a comfier workstation in bed and the purple color is spectacular.","positive":1},{"review":"  Really like this.  Used in in bed last night, and on the couch today.Even better - not shown in the picture is the rubber wrist rest that the bottom edge of the laptop rests on, and your wrists rest on, so the laptop doesnt slide, and you're not resting your wrists on cold metal as you type.Slightly finickity to adjust each of the joints, but each joint has a degree dial, so you can make note of your favorite positions, make note of them, and recreate them easily.","positive":1},{"review":"  It took my daughter a little effort to figure out how to use this, but now she uses it every day all day (pretty much). She can sit on her bed and essentially have a desk for her laptop. Also, it's just that much farther from her body, which I like. A great product - nothing wrong with it at all.","positive":1},{"review":"  I never want to work at a desk again.  My feet would swell and get ice cold sitting at a desk.  Yes, it takes a minute to understand the adjustments but only a minute.  And they are very easy to adjust - someone put a lot of thought into this design.","positive":1},{"review":"  A very nice lap table. I use it for everything.I caught my grandkid using it on the table while she stood. It works any way you want it to.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a really neat laptop stand riser and very nice looking - but I have one serious caveat. It is highly adjustable however you practically have to be an engineer with four hands to adjust it. Maybe I'll find a place where I want to keep it in the same position permanently but I didn't need this one to do that - there are cheaper stands than this. Right now I'm using a shoe box, in fact.","positive":0},{"review":"  Thought we were ordering Philomena but this  America on. Not much of a story.

Alas, not to be so.","positive":0},{"review":"  It claims to be made of \"100%\" aluminum alloy.  Alloy means its a mixture.  Very misleading.

I can lay down and use it or sit anywhere and use it.  I would buy again.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm using this desk while I write this review and have no real complaints.  Someone else had to adjust it for me and I haven't changed the position since.  I have a friend who uses and loves the table, so I think it's much more me to blame than the desk.  But trying to adjust it on my own skill produced laughable results, so be wary if you don't manipulate shapes well.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great change of pace sitting for working from home.  Can be used as a standing desk in a pinch if you are under 6'.","positive":1},{"review":"  Furinno did a great job on product design and manufactured delivery. The width easily accomodates my thighs. The aluminum frame and tray are very sturdy yet the entire assembly is very lightweight. It solves many of my ergonomic laptop computing needs in a stylish, effective and cost conscious manner.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very sturdy, able to use in many different positions. It's a bit short to use as a stand up table, but it is possible. Essentially, you're buying something that is hot and sits on your lap. Instead, this sits above your lap (even in bed), doesn't actually rest on you, and serves the same purpose.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this to use at work on top of my desk as a convertible \"standing desk\" and it is just perfect. Lightweight but sturdy (holds my 13\" MacBook Pro with space on the side for a little notepad or mouse just fine), easy to adjust, so many height settings. Way more cost-effective than buying a full standing desk, and I can just pop it underneath my desk if I need to sit. Thanks Furinno.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use it as a standing desk (with it on my bed or on a table,) for movie watching (tilted higher when I'm laying in bed) and when I'm sitting in a comfy chair.

It adjusts easily and once you have your usual setting it's easy peasy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I actually bought this to use as a stand for my laptop after injuring my back.

You can adjust this for a variety of uses like a seated desk at a couch, a bed desk or a standing desk if you place it on top of a table or desk.

I may need to experiment with different arrangements of the legs to find the most stable, if the sideways flex starts bothering me-  like maybe add a stabilizing bar with a couple of c-clamps.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had been looking for solutions to allow me to convert my desktop to a sitdown standup without having to change my desk. 3M had a nice (albeit expensive) popup keyboard, but it required over two feet of unblocked desk with for mounting, which was not possible for my desk.I would definitely recommend this tray for an easy and relatively cheap sitdown standup desk conversion for your mouse and keyboard (you also would need something else to raise lower the monitor). - just be aware of the actual usable area.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this for my laptop to use in bed while recovering from surgery. It worked okay. I did get a fair amount of use from it during recovery, but after I recovered from surgery, I ended up moving and throwing it away.I would recommend using this as a temporary aid in bed, given it`s fairly cheap.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product looks handy in the photos but ergonomically, it's horrible. It's challenging to set up to the right height, uncomfortable to use (the stopper digs into your wrists as you type), and it blocks bluetooth signals. The legs are difficult to adjust as you have to do angular computations or be OK with lots of trial and error. I can't recommend this or any other with the same design.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is not a folding portable \"desk\" or \"table\" by any stretch of the imaginaton.  With the legs fully extended to desk height it barely comes up to coffee table height.  Do not waste your money.  Just use a TV dinner tray instead.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this to use in way other than it was designed for. I wanted to use it to raise my keyboard and mouse up at my standing desk. What is nice is that each button is marked at 30 degree intervals in both directions - that helps to ensure the sides are at the same angle without having to eyeball it. Getting the mouse pad and main table at different angles was also tricky, and required a lot of trial and error.","positive":0},{"review":"  I found this to be difficult to figure out how to adjust the height, and a bit flimsy.  It moves around on the desktop, so you might have to put some rubber strips or something non-skid on the bottom.  I'm sure that it will work well for some people and not well for others.  I'm probably going to look for something else that is more comfortable for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  It works fairly well. This is the first I've bought of this type and so I have nothing to compare.This is a decent table, it handles my large 17\" laptop, but works much better better with my ultra book.  I just wish the quality was better - I wouldn't mind the extra weight and cost.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very lightweight which is nice for moving it around to a different room. Better for propping up a tablet or iPhone, would not recommend using it as a lap table where you might want to write or beat any weight. Not too big or small. Good for sitting in bed or a recliner.","positive":0},{"review":"  I dislike this product because it was not sturdy. I have an Mac Air 13 inches and when I placed my lab top on the surface the whole desk flipped over. I was also looking for something that I could place on my bed and this was not the stand for that. The stand only works when on a flat area.","positive":0},{"review":"  They use the term portable to excuse away the fact that this was made to barely handle it's own weight. Thin aluminum bars plastic joints barely can hold up a 15 inch HP laptop...","positive":0},{"review":"  Have a Gateway MD7309u 15.6\" laptop and the tray cannot hold it's weight.  My wife uses it all the time with her tablet and is pretty happy with it.  I will not put a heavy laptop like mine on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I think this would work great on a table, but it is a little more complicated on the bed which is what I got it for.  The problem is the bed isn't a stable surface, and there are only a few offsets at each joint.In hindsight, I would probably not buy this for the bed and would get one of those that are on a stand (that are on the floor) that slides over to the bed.  I didn't want to go with those because they are bulky, but this is cumbersome enough, that we really don't use it very often.","positive":0},{"review":"  First - for full disclosure - I was contacted by the seller and asked to give an unbiased review in exchange for an additional stand.  Well, since I enjoy the stand and had planned to one day get around to writing a review, it seems a no brainer to go ahead and actually write the review to get another stand, which I will probably give to my husband as he has been considering a standing desk.  I think if you start pricing some of the other standing desk alternatives, and you've never used a standing desk before, you'll come back to try out this option.  It has been a good value for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  I originally sought out a lap table because I'd broken my leg and needed a comfortable way to work on the couch (reading, using laptop, and grading papers). I hadn't planned on getting something like this (I didn't even know they existed) but, after reading a LOT of reviews, I decided to give this one a chance. I recommend that you spend a bit of time thinking about how you will use it so that you pick the one that is best for you.PS - My leg is healed now, but the stand still gets plenty of use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I do presentations at various locations and never know if the height of the stand or table will be the appropriate height for me.  It really worked out well for this. If you do this, I would recommend some kind of weight at the bottom\u2026small sand bags or something of the sort or hook the bottom of the legs under something solid to keep it in place.  If you just need to extend height on your desk or a table for more comfort, it works great.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is good for my purpose:  to hold my keyboard while I stand at my computer desk.  I will end up putting felt on the feet as it's a bit slippery on my wood desk. It's not super easy to adjust, but once I had it where I want it, it's just easiest to keep it there. Overall I am very happy and would recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's exactly what I needed. Fully adjustable, sleek, compact, lightweight and chic. Overall, works great and would highly recommend. As an added bonus, a lot of my colleagues have been impressed with my little setup now and find it to be an ingenious, easy fix for implementing a stand-up desk at your workstation - all thanks to this handy stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing is awesome. I wish I could give it 4 1 2 stars. I simply put a book in my lap under the desk and use the mouse there. But, overall it does exactly what I wanted it to do.","positive":1},{"review":"  It looks nice and folds up neatly for storage. However, the buttons on the side can be tricky to hold down while adjusting the angle, so much so that I avoided changing the configuration. The adjustable stand also lets me tilt the projector.I am very happy with this accidental use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like to work standing up most of the day -- even when I'm traveling.  Once your get the hang of how to extend and adjust the appendages of this stand it becomes quite a stable and sturdy platform for my notebook PC.  Really well.  I agree with another reviewer that you should probably keep the box as a convenient (and sturdy) carrier, however.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this in hopes it would work for both me and for my wife who is often \"bed bound\" to use to hold her iPad, reading books, laptop, etc.  I only bought one to see if it would work, with the idea I'd buy another if it did, and we would each be able to have one.It works well for me since I can make my adjustments and leave them alone.  I would recommend it, but be aware that you will have to search out some answers.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use it everyday.  It adapts to any situation, as I usually sit on my sofa which is uneven and each leg adjusts to keep it level.  Instructions on this would have been helpful.It is light weight yet feels sturdy.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's really not as easy to position as I thought and the \"feet\" rests are only good on flat surfaces. I tried to use this while just sitting on the couch and it  did not seat well. The \"lip\" that secures the laptop means that it will only secure it either flat or tilted upward so the laptop rests against the lip--again that limits choices of adjustments. Overall, I thought it was a decent product.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is VERY flimsy and the mouse area is too narrow.  Guess thats what \"Flex\" in the product name really means.  If you buy this product, get sum rubber or felt pads for the legs.  The whole Item would be better if it didn't flex but I find the flexing too anoying for daily use.","positive":0},{"review":"  I would give it 5 starts if following things are improved:1. You cannot center the laptop when you have table over you lap because the foldable lip is quite small. Put a few thin rubber tabs on the surface to prevent laptop sliding away easily.The company should add 6 lips, 3 on laptop side in the front, 2 on the sides, and 1 on the mouse side.","positive":0},{"review":"  Bought this to try and convert my sitting desk into a standing desk and or make my laptop position more ergonomic when sitting. Extremely easy to setup, feels plenty sturdy for my laptop and a few accessories (external HD, extra USB ports) to sit on it. I have found however that because of the number of different settings moving pieces on this stand, that I have been reluctant to fiddle with all the different positions and I leave it stationary all time. It's a good value if you don't need to move it very much but I would probably opt for the more expensive standing desk options if I needed to change the position much more frequently.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product seemed to be the most budget conscious and out of all the competitors it seemed as if it's mechanics were the most adjustable to fit any ergonomic position. It doesn't work as well because it wasn't as sturdy and doesn't have a strong foundation if you have a heavier duty laptop. Using it for gaming was out of the question.","positive":0},{"review":"  Review for the model with the mouse extension:Works after some modification. The connection between the platforms for the laptop and mouse is poor and bends with slight pressure. If you are undecided, choose the model without the platform for the mouse.Overall, it works fine now, it's a bit cheap feeling and could use some type of rubber feet to prevent slipping and provide stability.","positive":0},{"review":"  Of all the settings for this folding laptop table, I finally gave up on it.  Using my lap now which is more comfortable.  Nice unit, solid build, but just not for me.  I have another different folding laptop table that I never use for the same reasons.","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price, this thing is made pretty cheaply. The legs are wobbly and made of cheap plastic. I suppose they dislike like honest reviews. Lowering another star for that.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is an OK product if you're looking for something affordable and simple. I wish the mouse pad had an adjustable height. The middle setting is good height for the mousepad, but then you're looking down at the screen (if you're using it as a standing desk as I tried to.) I will use this on and off even though it's less than ideal because I want to alternate between sitting while working and standing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very flimsy construction, just a bit thicker than an aluminium foil.Does not stand properly on the bed, needs a hard and flat surface below.Not at all worth the money (actually not worth buying even if cost much less than it is).Returned immediately.","positive":0},{"review":"  For the price on here, it is very much worth the price. For me, personally, I like being able to just lay down with a laptop to do work, browse the web ect.This product is a great buy for its price. For the materials, and design work put into this it should actually be around twice it's actual price.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has turned out to be a pretty handy item to have around. I use it mostly as a standing desk and then when I sit on the floor or bed. I have never used the mouse area for an actual mouse, though, so I can't speak to how that feature would work. Overall, I'm a happy camper.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this specifically to elevate my laptop at work to standing height and I've never used it any other way. I'm not particularly tall so I didn't need much elevation but I suspect the product would be slightly wobbly if you get higher than the 7 inches I'm using it at. Instead, there is a small compartment in the surface of the big tray that has a metal cover that can be lifted up and (I suspect) used to brace your laptop. I just hook the ridges of my laptop over the back edge of the tray though so I'm not sure how sturdy the pop-up would be.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm stuck in bed or on the couch for ten weeks due to a fractured foot and torn ligament.  This desk is  amazing.  Oh, I am also fine eating with a glass of liquid on it.  Quite stable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use two of these to make a standing desk anywhere.  The first I use to put my yoga pro II on so that it as eye level.  Not a big deal though.Overall a great product for DIY and mobile stand up desks.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have really enjoyed the convenience, versatility, and usefulness of this stand. I've used it on the floor, on a counter that's a bit too low, while lying in bed, on a coffee table, etc.However, this wasn't a deal breaker for me. I mainly love this table just because it served its purpose: allowing me to use my tiny laptop anywhere, and making it easier on my back and neck.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am disabled and have to spend most of my time in bed. I am also enrolled back in college so I have to spend a lot of time on the computer. I tried a different table from Amazon a while back and it was pretty flimsy. Ive been using this one daily for over 2 months and it's holding up well.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is a nice product.  I bought it for use in bed for a Macbook Pro 13.  Also, if you rest the legs on top of the sheets, you might have to make sure it is steady especially if other people in the bed are moving around.Overall, it is a nice device and has helped me work in bed more comfortably.","positive":1},{"review":"  The notebook stand definitely does what it says. It can be adjusted to any shape and angle as necessary. But at the price this is a steal. This is one of the most important pieces of furniture in my apartment today.","positive":1},{"review":"  I actually use this so I can use a portable monitor and my laptop on the same level (rather than using the smaller panel for my mouse). It's a little flimsier than I thought it might be, and I have to be careful that the monitor doesn't slip off. I've addressed that issue by keeping a rubberized drawer liner in my work bag and putting that between the stand and the monitor.","positive":1},{"review":"  too lightweight. Made it top heavy. I knew this wouldn't last. I returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not what I expected.  It has to be flat for the mouse.","positive":0},{"review":"  I received it broken.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am disappointed in this. Yes, it will suffice.6\" and  a mouse should play video games, but it is not worth $45+. I feel taken advantage of.","positive":0},{"review":"  Just received this today. It's ok, I was expecting something really sturdy. It's just too wobbly for me, every time I start typing on the laptop the whole thing giggles. Also, there is a noticeable sag between the split tray.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very light, and flexible with infinite ways to position.  Only issue is it does not feel as sturdy and the feet does not have a good grip.  Time will tell.  Weight makes it very portable, but not easy to take along on commute or travel as it is long because of the mouse platform.","positive":0},{"review":"  Update: Lowered it form 5 stars to 3. I found this table too flimsy to use on a daily use. Other 'office' products with the same purpose this run in the $100s+. Just keep it simple with this thing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Adjustment takes more time and patience. A inexpensive solution to standing.","positive":0},{"review":"  Returned.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is pretty flimsy..  For the price, not the quality I expected. I feel that if I rest my hand on the mouse to hard, or rest my wrist too hard, it would collapse.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm a consultant and this portable standing desk is great for my work lifestyle (traveling to clients and working from my laptop). I bought this item so that I would not have to sit all day. My coworker's stands would wiggle with the slightest movement on their laptop, including typing.3) Good quality material.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had a little difficulty learning how to adjust the legs at first. Once I got used to it then it's a good temporary desk to use on the couch or bed. If you're looking for something to use long term in an office chair then you should buy something else. I use this with a surface and sometimes to lift my desktop keyboard and convert my desk to a standing desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this riser. I spend many hours working on my computer and by the end of several hours, my posture is not aserect as it should be. Therefore, my neck, shoulders, and lower back become stiff, achy, and sore. The riser helps me tomaintain the correct posture and I'm not as uncomfortable after working several hours.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really needed a lap table to use while I am in bed typing.  I wanted something that would give me not only a place to put the keyboard but also a way to personalize its position.It came in a short amount of time, well packed.  Give had it for so e time now and expect it to last very long.","positive":1},{"review":"  While I wish that this table was a little longer and had either a longer or second lip it works great. It is very stable and easy to use while it locks solidly in place once you have set it to your preferred angle. It also works great as a reading table when I need a hard surface to mark on papers and am not using a laptop. I can bear down very heavily on it without any indications of stress.","positive":1},{"review":"  First off I do love this thing. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the center section seems like a weak point. I'm writing a book and use it most of the day almost every day and its doing great so far. I would definitely recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was the perfect, reasonably priced desk top stand for my lap top for use with my treadmill at my desk..  You won't be disappointed.  Tip - if your stand slides on your desk, you can use a small rug gripper mat to keep it perfectly still.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a decently heavy 15.6\" laptop and this had no problem with supporting it when the desk was in the right position.I was also considering getting the one with the fans integrated into the pad, but it didn't have a section for the mouse. I wish it could come with fans and a mouse section, but I'm glad I went with this one.","positive":1},{"review":"  The fact that this adjustable laptop table can be used lying down comfortably is worth the price it self. My sister had troubles with her back while long study periods and then I surprised her with this adjustable laptop portable table.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this table for my husband who is an advid pc gamer but we had no table space for him to play so we found this.It is quality made out of aluminum.We have also sat it on the floor like a table and the arms were easy to use and the table was able to sit on the floor with the laptop on it with no priblem.Overall I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a way to elevate a laptop or for doing paper work while sitting in comfort on their couch.","positive":1},{"review":"  it's a little flimsy. I did like the way that the legs lock and unlock into multiple positions but it's too light. If it were heavier it would be more stable.","positive":0},{"review":"  it works....","positive":0},{"review":"  Needed something to get laptop off my legs while sitting on couch.  This fills the bill but, if I did it again, would probably buy one of the cheaper, narrower, ones that are available. Also the section for the mouse is useless unless you have a mouse pad that fits on it because the metal is too slick to use a mouse without a pad. Overall seems decently made but have only used it for 6 weeks.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love this versatile desk. It seems a bit flimsy, so I'm afraid to put a lot of load on it, but it serves great as a portable computer desk. If the surface can be made truly black (with, say, non-reflective flat-black paint), the product would be even better.Thanks.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is very flimsy and doesn`t support my MacBook Air well. I will be returning it to the seller.","positive":0},{"review":"  Although it's a pain to change from one angle to another, the standing feature is great.

Very sturdy and well made.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great design however a little weak with a full size laptop. The legs bow out a but.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this in order to stand more, as sitting all day at work was bothering my back and just seemed generally unhealthy.  Overall this product does the trick -- it's nice that's it's relatively small and light, so if I want to move it out of the way or place my computer on my desk for a bit and sit I can.  Other standing desk options I looked at were not adjustable (for added stability), but knowing that something that is the wrong height was going to just hurt me wrists and arms I'm glad I went with this.  Great deal for the money.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like the adjustability of this folding table. I use it often in my adjustable bed. I have not used it on the couch, but I can see it being adjusted to the perfect sitting postion.Also, nice for a \"breakfast in bed\" table.","positive":1},{"review":"  What can I say about this folding laptop desk. It's perfect for kicking back in the bed while surfing the net or playing some games on the pc. I looked at so many different models of folding laptop desks but settled on this one because it was one of the few that would fit a 17 inch laptop and still have room for the mouse because I hate using the touchpad. Extremely happy with this desk and highly recommend it for anyone with a larger laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  It is a little tedious to adjust, if I've wanted to not use a standing desk I've just put it under my desk rather than flattening it, it's a little wobbly when typing.  It might be neat to have a stabilizing bar with rotating clamps on the ends that would clamp on to the upper bars to give it a little more stability (I'm not even sure that would work.)  I wish the flip up thing that holds the laptop if the stand is tilted was a bit less tall, it's taller than the base of my laptop so I have scraped my hands on it a couple of times.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this for keyboard mouse usage instead of laptop mouse usage. Keyboard's a bit longer than the laptop holder side, but it works for me. I may also cut a mouse pad or mouse pad material to size and secure it to the mouse side.It's comfortable, light-weight, simple, smart, and I was surprised by the nice material.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm quite pleased and surprised with this laptop riser that I bought for work. Compared to a different brand that I bought last year for my home office, the Pwr+ is considerably better built with a charcoal gun-metal look accented with stainless functional pieces. Neither of these is a big deal in practice, though.Overall, I found the Pwr+ FlexTop to be a terrific value for a truly high-quality product that withstands everyday use.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to be able to work on my laptop in bed.  When my back starts hurting from hours at my desk I can still work while laying down now.  : )  Very lightweight too.  I'm very happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this everyday.  EVERY DAY.  It might not work in a narrower chair unless you were sitting it on the arm rests.  This is how I use it in the car and it works great.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this after I was injured and had to keep my leg elevated and iced most of the day. I was unable to sit at my desk at all. It's lightweight, but sturdy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for portable laptop desk. Price was right too.","positive":1},{"review":"  I purchased this product for use at home and for when I facilitate workshops. While this is not a devise that I would plan to use all day, every day, it is perfect for when you want (should) to get out of your chair and continue working.

It was fairly easy to setup the height (I am 6'1\") that worked for me.","positive":1},{"review":"  Was difficult to adjust.","positive":0},{"review":"  Seems to work great, but how in the world does the flex top flex.  I don't want to break it, but no instructions kind of leaves it to trial and error. With good instructions, I would have rated 4-5 stars.","positive":0},{"review":"  not as advertised, flimsy and cheaply made, I only kept it because I accidentally threw away the box and didn't want to bother buying packaging to return it, I wasn't expecting much and I got less, much less.","positive":0},{"review":"  not easy to set-up.","positive":0},{"review":"  it is small all the dimensions are wrong, it does not move or contour like it says it does , save your money and go to wal mart.","positive":0},{"review":"  Sorry, but this simply isn't sturdy enough.

It's Excellent. I would recommend for ipads or lightweight mini PCs, but not heavy PCs or desktops. Plus the bonus mousepad area for right-handers.","positive":1},{"review":"  When I compared the laptop desks to buy, there were a few concerns I had.  First, would it fit my rather large laptop (I don't split-adjust the two separate parts of the desk, but I think the laptop is 17\") and still have room to use the mouse beside.  It's a good quality item at a good price, that lets me use the computer sitting comfortably back on my couch, rather than hunched over the coffee table.  Success.","positive":1},{"review":"  Takes a little fiddling around to get the hang of it, but very handy and stable enough. Nice that the mouse tray can be angled separately.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've had this for a couple months and during that time it's mostly been set up on my counter.

I have a Macbook Air for school and a bulkier Dell laptop for work, I believe the tab could be half it's size and still keep either laptops from sliding off of the stand. With that said, I would not stop that from recommending this product to friends and family, because it keeps the laptop off of my lap (eliminating the infamous crotch perspiration) and keeps it up high so that I am able to work at a more comfortable angle no matter where I'm sitting.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently purchased my first laptop and was looking for a comfortable way to use it while sitting up in bed.  I didn't want a heavy tray, and I needed something that had legs.  I've used it frequently and haven't found any drawbacks yet.  Highly recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  Bought this stand for my desk at work.  Adjusting the legs was a little tricky to figure out since you have to adjust them separately, but once I got one side to my preferred height, adjusting the other side wasn't so bad.  The stand feels sturdy, I don't feel like its going to break or slip under the weight of my laptop and me pressing down on it or leaning on it.  This is by no means a fancy product, but if you're looking for a light weight, sleek looking stand to use, this is a great option.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm using this to support a keyboard and mouse in a 'poor-man's standup desk' situation, and in this regard, it's working incredibly well.  The table is light, but sufficiently sturdy for keyboard and mouse usage.No comment on how effective this table would be supporting a labtop.  I suspect for lighter Ultrabooks MacAir's it would probably work fine, but my older heavy MacBook Pro (2009) is very unstable on it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I ordered this because I recently had ankle surgery and have to use my laptop in bed for a few weeks.  Anyone who has used their laptop resting on their thighs for hours can attest that it gets extremely uncomfortable.  I would rather deal with a little bit of wobblyness than continue to burn my thighs up with a hot laptop for hours.  Once my cast is off, this will make a great addition to my desk in the family room where I will keep my laptop resting on it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great portable folding table that keep your electronic away from you (not on your lap anymore..  This portable folding tablet provide the necessary comfort to spend hours on the computer.  The split table to accommodate the mouse is a great idea and provide plenty of space for the mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  It works well and is very versatile. Use it while working on the couch, working at your desk, or even on the kitchen counter while standing. HOWEVER, I had to put a non-slip surface \"mat\" on it to prevent things from sliding off when moved or when the table is set at an angle. That is a minor inconvenience though.","positive":1},{"review":"  yeah it's cheap looking but it works. I like that it has a mouse landing area that also fits a mouse pad. I use it standing up for the most part. Not sure how stable it would be on my lap or bed, but works fine for table or counter top to use my laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  This Laptop desk is quite versatile. I bought it so that I would be able to use my laptop from my bed. I can now use my laptop on my bed or on the floor without any strain on my back.By the way, you can position this laptop desk but you would have to correct your own posture :)Highly recommended if you like surfing the web from a comfy place.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's just what I wanted a laptop stand with a spot for my mouse. Setup is simple and converts for many positions. The only thing I regret is not buying the silver for one because I feel the black surface will get pretty scratched up. But I am going to grab one for my office as well.","positive":1},{"review":"  The product is not sturdy enough, it wiggles a lot. The idea is there but needs improvement.","positive":0},{"review":"  Flimsy, cheap, too light and poorly designed with the mousepad- not stable.","positive":0},{"review":"  cheap flimsy plastic.. can't type more..","positive":0},{"review":"  Is what it is, not really super functional.","positive":0},{"review":"  it's ok. Not sturdy. the middle sags down when a laptop is placed. When I type the whole thing shakes lightly making the screen shake as well.","positive":0},{"review":"  I don't even use it.  I really didn't like the legs.  It just didn't fit my needs.","positive":0},{"review":"  The stand is a bit rickety--not terribly so, but enough that it is annoying. If you can get over it, though, it's a handy product.","positive":0},{"review":"  not stable enough.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product does fit my needs of raising my laptop up.  It isn't as stable as I expected it to be.  I felt like I was going to break the stand trying to move the mouse portion.  I expected for the price point for the item to be of a better quality and more functional.","positive":0},{"review":"  Terrible item. Broke with very little weight on it.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this for 1 purpose: to hold my really heavy alienware 17 and stick my mechnical keyboard underneath.1 sentence summary: it held the alienware 17 perfectly and and is strong. As long as you don't have anything that touches the laptop all the time. It will not wobble.","positive":1},{"review":"  Using this with a 15\" laptop, seated on a bed, I settled on a configuration that reverses the design - the table extends towards me and the \"mouse\" partition is on the left.  I am using a regular mouse, on the bed, not the table.  I opted for this config as it was the best way to angle the table on a very slight rising grade, which was best for typing.  I suggest improving the product by even finer adjustment of the table angle and more sliding friction  less smooth table surface.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a nice stand that can be used both as a riser on a desk to move a laptop to a more ergonomic height, and also to make using a computer on a couch or bed more comfortable. It frequently switches between these two tasks at my home office with just a few minor adjustments. I wish it was a little cheaper, but still a good value. Overall a good product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been so perfect for moving from one chair to bed to table with my whole \"office\" on one plate.  It took me awhile to figure out how to have the mouse and main part of table separate to be in different angles.  The table is stable and light.","positive":1},{"review":"  This laptop desk is perfect for me. It's light and sturdy at the same time.  Getting the legs positioned takes a bit of maneuvering but the degree measurements on each side helps tremendously.  I have already recommended it to friends.","positive":1},{"review":"  The seller was very prompt in shipping the item and it arrived exactly when they promised.  The product itself is very adjustable into nearly an position and angle.  We use it for a Surface Pro 2 and it is not quite long enough for the kick stand and keyboard to be completely on the device, but it does not affect it's use as the Surface's center of gravity is different than a laptop's anyway.  I recommend it for anyone who needs something so they can sit up in bed and work.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently purchased the PW+ FlexTop Portable Laptop-Table and I am pleased with it. Initially it was a bit of a challenge to adjust, but It comes with an illustrated guide that was very helpful. I do wish that the mouse pad area was able to adjust independently of the rest of the desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  Does the job well. It`s a little cumbersome to adjust the height and get it balanced out.  It`s pretty sturdy.  I use it at work to work standing up some times.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is AWESOME. I use it in my recliner, and in bed. Am going to order a 2nd one for my daughter. I highly recommend getting it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Incredibly versatile in the way it folds so that you can set it up on the couch, in a chair, your bed -- I love it.  It has transformed my use of my laptop since I really can take it anywhere and use it with ease now that I have this portable stand.  The stand is also lightweight and easy to move.  It is also great for holding books kindle Fire for reading in bed.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works pretty good, the size is right, locks into place and is lightweight. The only draw backs are: Needs rubber feet on the legs from sliding around on desk surface, it is a little flimsy and wish it had a non-slip surface on work area. It has come in very handy considering my wife (user) works from home and prefers to stand as she works.","positive":0},{"review":"  I wanted to try out the \"standing office\"  concept so I set up my tray on my desk. It does not have rubber grips so the entire tray slides a bit. The spot where you would put your mouse does not have a raised edge to keep the mouse from sliding off the tray.","positive":0},{"review":"  Too flimsy wobbly to actually use. Just cumbersome. I never use it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Not what I expected at all.  Too difficult to get it the correct position and not nearly as sturdy as I expected.  Would never purchase another one.","positive":0},{"review":"  It works but I am concerned about quality of material....","positive":0},{"review":"  It took a while to get the legs adjusted.","positive":0},{"review":"  Too flimsy , not worth buying.","positive":0},{"review":"  It fell off on my bed (uneven surface). This is probably due to its design. It has an even button which means it will align with the surface it sits on.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great price but the quality is cheap.","positive":0},{"review":"  Does take a bit of time to get used to but this is great. Great for my posture. Side tray is great for a mouse or a cup of coffee if you're living life on the  edge.

Set up was a breeze.","positive":1},{"review":"  I originally ordered this portable laptop desk when I broke my kneecap. I often work from home and really couldn't sit at my desk. It is sturdy yet very lightweight. One of my best buys of 2015.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this to convert my desk to a stand-up-desk. I put my monitor on the shelf above where it normally sits, then place my wireless keyboard and mouse on this.It is a little small for both the keyboard and mouse to fit, but it is definitely still manageable and functional. I definitely recommend this to anyone trying to create a make-shift stand-up-desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  This table is amazingly sturdy, easy to adjust, light and fits perfectly in our easy chairs and recliners between the arms with ample hip room. I would recommend this table to my mother-in-law knowing even she would be pleased with this table.","positive":1},{"review":"  Nice, cheap alternative to purchasing a standing desk. At first I thought it was too big - it's wide - but after I figured out how to adjust the legs and got it set up with my laptop and mouse, it's perfect. Definitely sturdy enough for that. The only drawback is that I might have to put some kind of adhesive or something under the legs because they are smooth and they might shift slip more easily across my desktop than I'd like.","positive":1},{"review":"  We chose this as an inexpensive option for raising a laptop on a desk to be used as a standing desk.  Unfortunately, it wasn't quite tall enough for our purposes, so we put a large cardboard box underneath to make it higher.  It seems sturdier than I anticipated.  Overall, does a great job of doing as advertised at a great price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Accomplishes what I bought it for but it is sometimes a little difficult to adjust to suit the book or tablet.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a bit lighter than I expected but serves very well for converting my home office to standing desk setup. Bit of a challenge to get the angles right for the height I wanted and the guide doesn't help, I just played around with it for awhile til I got it where I wanted it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is absolutely exactly what I was looking for. I work from home and am on a computer most of the day, so I love being able to change the height and stand up to work. I also love the space for the mouse - I wasn't sure at first how i could alter its position (it wasn't in any of the instructions) but you just pull apart lightly and it rotates really easily.","positive":1},{"review":"  I hated this thing. I honestly do not know why this gets such good reviews..now I'm off to search again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very cheap  made. too complicate .","positive":0},{"review":"  not sturdy enough to feel confortable to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is a good table, however would prefer it to have been wider for more heavy laptops.","positive":0},{"review":"  I want to return to them.","positive":0},{"review":"  not as easy to adjust as described.","positive":0},{"review":"  pain in the neck to get positioned.","positive":0},{"review":"  I have been waiting more than a week for this product and now I am really upset.the actual size of the tray is 13.5 inches\" who cares for that >:<In addition the tray and mouse pad cannot easily be separated, in fact I couldn't separate them at all.But it is really weight.","positive":0},{"review":"  The image is deceptive. The right side platform does not angle down so you can put your mouse on it. Also, more flimsy than it appears.","positive":0},{"review":"  awkward to use.","positive":0},{"review":"  I got this for my dad as a Father's Day gift and he adored it. It has so many different possibilities and really allows for optimal comfort while getting work done. So happy with this product.The only reason I'm giving 4 5 stars is because the little sheet provided with all the different laptop positions is a bit confusing at first and could be clearer  more user-friendly.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought it for my daughter to use in bed, as she works at home a lot. She commented it was very light weight, and very comfortable to work on. She liked the split surface function,and the flexibility of height allowed by the leg design.  She also liked that it can also fit nicely in a large suitcase for a business or long family trip.","positive":1},{"review":"  After a few weeks of use this product is exactly what I was looking for. An inexpensive alternative to a stand up desk.  Not every configuration works for my use, but the handy picture card that comes with it is a helpful guide to try out different set ups.  If at first you don't feel the stand is working, give a few of the set ups a try and you are bound to find one that fits your needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  My wife has lower back trouble.  Sitting all day at work makes for a long day.  Now that she has this desk, she can simple adjust it to holder her keyboard while the folding desk sit on her regular desk.

Easy to use, sturdy, and able to adjust for any position I find myself in. I mostly use it in bed and it works great.

Very cheap quality.if I increase the height it will dance.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works well but won't last long without modifications.  The connection points between the plastic inserts and Al is the issue.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is kind of difficult to adjust, but works well once it is set up.  It is light weight as well.","positive":0},{"review":"  Product was easy to set up.  Not sturdy enough for what I needed.","positive":0},{"review":"  The tray is not anything like it says.  The only good thing is that it is light weight.  The mouse pad is on the left, but the picture is on the right.  There are not vent holes in the tray.","positive":0},{"review":"  I bought this thinking that I will be able to use it regularly for laptop use at home however after using it once I have not picked it up again. The reason being that its very difficult to adjust the legs to the position you desire and impossible to do so without referring to the manual guide. I wanted something easy that's pick up and use so please be warned if that's what you are looking for from this product.","positive":0},{"review":"  I hate it, waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  like a set of robotic arms to keep yourself comfy and productive.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use my Mac to do a lot of homework, and I always feel uncomfortable after long time studying sit on the chair.

And the worst part, after throwing out the diagram and getting it to stand up myself, this could not bear the weight of my 15-inch work computer.

Saves me from upper back shoulder neck pain since I'm not sitting all the time. Although I've never figured out how to adjust the mouse portion of the table, it actually works well because the mouse extension makes the surface extra wide, accommodating both  my laptop and the mouse mousepad. Others have recommended keeping the box to transport the table, that is good advice -- protects it and gives it stability.","positive":1},{"review":"  I looked at several styles and am delighted with this version of the portable folding laptop for my desk at wotk.

It was also easy to adjust.","positive":1},{"review":"  This was the perfect option for a standing desk at work. I love how the height is adjustable and there is room for both my MacBook and my mouse.

I've already had multiple people in the office ask me for the info and where I bought it.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's a little time consuming to get it adjusted to perfection the first time.

My neck feels better already. **I should mention I am using a MacBook Air, and it is thin and doesn't get hot or weigh much so no need for ventilation, and it is super sturdy for my Mac.","positive":1},{"review":"  I LOVE this laptop stand. It`s made my life much easier.It`s very lightweight, adjustable, but still sturdy enough to hold my laptop. I love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pretty good. LOVE that the side stand mouse pad can be on either side. It's hard to get them locked in place at a matched angle the first time.The platform for the computer is sturdy, but the mouse pad shelf has a bit too much flex and doesn't feel solid.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, you get what you pay for. If you're buying the cheapest standing desk option, you're going to get it. But again, you get what you pay for. It works well enough for me to keep.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this board to use as a keyboard holder as opposed to a laptop stand. The overall quality feels good. The mouse tray's angle is adjustable so that's a plus and if you're left handed, you can switch the mouse tray side. I'd recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is just about exactly what I was looking for.  I use it most when I go to bed, so I can watch something on my Kindle. Arrived quickly, I was skeptical when delivered bc it had no outside box or packaging wrap and had a hole poked through box.I love it though.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this chill pad and use it daily.  The legs are not as easy to adjust as you can't do them both at the same time.  But once you get it into your position it works great and makes surfing much more comfortable.","positive":1},{"review":"  I often draw on my iPad while on the couch, in bed, at a table and all of these places require me to hunch over causing a lot of back and shoulder pain. This stand eliminates that issue.  I also love that the materials are sturdy and do not feel cheap. Cannot say enough good things about this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Vendor sent both boxes in a way that it was obvious it was not new, but returned. (First was missing parts and box was heavily ripped into and tape back shut, second was opened with less barbarity and re-taped shut but still in the bubble wrap) and neither came with any kind of instructions.  It is small so can be moved when you don't need it without issue.Overall does what it is supposed to.","positive":0},{"review":"  The height is incredibly annoying to change. You have to match up the numbers on each side and then on each angle.. but not if you want to change it often.","positive":0},{"review":"  It is so uncomfortable to adjust. The knobs are too tight, you have to take off the laptop every time you want to change angles, it actually fell once from it (thank goodness it was on my lap. It arrived in the original box and not in Amazon box, protected. Sorry I bought it, going to return.","positive":0},{"review":"  I am a grad school student. I wanted to be able to use this to get things up off my desk and free up some room so that I could have more space. I may use it in bed to put my laptop on it, but overall, I'm still without the tool i wanted to help my neck with reading and it is sitting in the corner collecting dust. Thank you.","positive":0},{"review":"  Great idea, poor production result. The majority of the unit is metal, thumbs up for durability, right. Will NEVER purchase again unless they upgrade the quality of the most significant component of the product. Huge THUMBS DOWN.","positive":0},{"review":"  I really wanted to like this but one of the buttons got stuck when I first tried to adjust it so if you accidentally push the button too far in the whole stand becomes completely useless because it`s flopping over. Also it`s way too small for the belly if you just want to lay under it in bed because you can`t really shift under it comfortably at all. I`ll go with the ultra large model.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like that this product is sturdy and will hold my Macbook. On the other hand, I do not like the manual part of having to rotate the legs around to get it to fit to your liking and sometimes when rotating the legs it can become uneven and so that takes time for you to figure out which leg is off and which way to turn the leg to make it stand evenly and high enough for you. I tried to go the cheaper route with the ergonomic, but honestly sometimes getting it to my standard is a waste of my time. Think I will just order another ergonomic just because it seems the more expensive ones I think they are less of an hassle to maneuver.","positive":0},{"review":"  Upon adjusting to my desired height and using for a day or two, i attempted to readjust. It became all too clear that one side had become distorted. It is permanently bent and thus stuck in this same position, rendering the product only slightly useful.","positive":0},{"review":"  I like the table. Legs have good adjustable range. Mouse never really rests and when you type the mouse will roll off the side from the vibration. There is no side to side adjustment for it just front to back.","positive":0},{"review":"  Wouldn`t stand up securely. Everyone I walked away it would topple over. Adjusting the legs was a complete hassle.","positive":0},{"review":"  Love it. Once you figure out the legs, it is quick to setup and take down. My PC gets too hot to keep it on my lap and this does great to keep it away from my legs. I do recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I don't give anything 5 stars.  I like it and use it every day. I just have it straddle one leg when I use it when I am sitting on the couch.  Comes assembled, just have to just the legs to where you are comfortable.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does what it's mean't for, and clicks in many different shapes and forms with legs to fit your needs, laying down no problem, sitting up no issues besides you moving on a bed and the keyboard and mouse will tend to slide around. It would be great for an artist or someone with a laptop or tablet, not and external keyboard and mouse.","positive":1},{"review":"  Was looking for something to use while I was sitting on the couch and trying to use my computer..  It's a little cumbersome to adjust but once it is in place it rocks..","positive":1},{"review":"  I didn't expect much and was happily surprised.  During the shutdown, I've been missing my Varidesk at work.  This works.  It is not a lifetime solution, but it is working well for now.","positive":1},{"review":"  Setting it up is a bit of a physics lesson, but very useful once you have it positioned the way you like. I do not recommending sharing with another person - you'll both get tired of adjusting it. Get one for each of you. Otherwise a good purchase especially for the price.","positive":1},{"review":"  For the price, I thought I got a great deal.

It is a little difficult to adjust at times.","positive":1},{"review":"  Absolutely no complaints.  Packaged well and shipped quickly.  Sturdy and holds the laptop easily.  Happy with this product and purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been using it for about half a year. I mostly put it on my desk to raise my laptop's position.In sum, if you want a sturdy book laptop supporter, go for something else. You may have to pay more, but you don't want to pay for something that would be broken in 6 months of use.","positive":0},{"review":"  For starters you need to be a rubic-cube expert to get it set up at the proper angle. Also, I don't think it is sturdy steady enough. I gifted mine to a sibling who wanted to give it a go.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product might work if you set it once and never use the \"adjustable\" feature.  I adjusted this a total of three (4) or four (4) times, and while the action was not smooth and you can tell this product is cheap, it at least adjusted.  Would NOT suggest anyone buy this.  it is super cheap.","positive":0},{"review":"  My wife bought this for her 16\" laptop. No place for a mouse with a larger laptop. It is now sitting under our living room table.","positive":0},{"review":"  When tilted 30 degrees, the lip of the tray doesn't hold my laptop. It slips forward since my laptop is thicker than the lip and curved.","positive":0},{"review":"  Works as advertised, but just wasn't a comfortable as I was hoping. I'm not as productive when standing and it's too easy to get distracted and walk away. My feet and back starts to hurt after a little while.

The buttons to change the angle are a little on the stiff side but to get it all setup and even is very simple.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does what it says, holds up my laptop great and all, but it's pretty difficult to adjust and get each side even.","positive":1},{"review":"  I had such a hard time deciding which adjustable laptop stand to purchase. I'm glad I bought this one. I've had it a month and it seems sturdy. I definitely recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  For me this is a stand to hold heavy books while sitting in bed.  It is totally adjustable in height and angles and strong enough to hold a really heavy book and a clamped on light with a flexible neck.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's okay. It's a pain in the ass to get it to where you want it. It's nice having the boost for my herniated neck. Overall I'm happy with the purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  It does what it says and is just what I use 99% of the time while sitting.","positive":1},{"review":"  Have really enjoyed this, I even got one for my granddaughter. Great gift idea.","positive":1},{"review":"  Used this for MacBook and laptop. Lots of adjustments and ways to use. Highly recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is just what I was looking for.  I stand up until I tire then sit down.  Just the right height when it's standing on a desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  This did not disappoint.

It's kind of difficult and complicated to adjust it but once set (and just once) it pretty stable.","positive":0},{"review":"  Don't buy this produce the fan broke super fast and the stand is made with super cheap plastic.","positive":0},{"review":"  i did not try it yetbut it did not look the same as i thought it ismay be i did not check it correctly before purchasing it.","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is made of cheap, flimsy plastic. The hinge joints are sloppy and destined for failure. The design is good, and if it was made of aluminum instead of junk plastic, it might just work. I returned it immediately.","positive":0},{"review":"  Some people might be okay with it, but it felt pretty flimsy and I could never get it in the right position...","positive":0},{"review":"  This is all plastic and very flimsy.  I returned it since it wasn't able to hold my laptop with any stability.","positive":0},{"review":"  Super cheap. The little push in tabs on the sides do not click into place to keep it steady. I returned it.","positive":0},{"review":"  it doesn't seem durable...we'll see.","positive":0},{"review":"  Everything's good but a week later, the fan started to make bad noise. I didn't want to spend more time to return and get a new one.","positive":0},{"review":"  I definitely like this thing. I was worried it wasn't going to be nearly sturdy enough.The only drawback is the part that flips up to hold the computer can potentially dig into your wrist, depending how you type or click.It could definitely stick out a little less and still be effective.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this for my Son to use as a stand for his Launchpad.  He tried several other options before finding this stand and it is exactly what he needed.He is also a computer science major and uses his laptop in class everyday and he has been using this for that as well.  This is perfect for multiple uses and I highly recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  As a 100% disabled veteran I am not able to sit at a desk so I have had many laptop trays with, and without, fans over the course of 10 years.  I am always looking for a better laptop tray and then I found my Pwr+ Portable Folding Laptop Notebook Tray with 2 fans.  I have told my family and friends about my Prw+ tray and I am planning on giving them for gifts in the future.  As a matter of fact I could use another one for road trips.","positive":1},{"review":"  The seller shipped the item promptly. I received it as scheduled. The stand can adjust to many different heights to accommodate most needs and it's sturdy enough to hold my laptop and cradle and even my hood hair dryer. Overall, happy with this purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Initially I liked this product, but found that when put in place it slide all over the desk when the laptop was touched. To have got it to my liking I would have had to fit some non-slip things to the bottom of the frame. It just didn't do what I particularly wanted it to do. But no a bad product nonetheless.","positive":1},{"review":"  It Keeps my laptop cool and well ventilated because laptop rests on top with the fans running underneath when laptop is on. This is reassuring since my 16\" laptop is a workstation and tends to run hot.. much better than having it on my covers and warming me up and it having to work hard to stay cool.","positive":1},{"review":"  Its a decent bed or couch table, height is not too tall that was my concern as i intended to use it as a laptop tray table. Other than that if you are considering a laptop tray for bed or couch so u don't have to keep the laptop on the lap all the time then definitely give it a try.Update: i have updated the review to full stars as the stand is still in great shape after years of use, no issues with the fans which is great as i thought they will go out very soon but they are fine with regular maintenance and cleaning, highly recommended..","positive":1},{"review":"  Compact but still sturdy enough not to worry me, with plenty of flexibility in the adjustable legs to position it comfortably and conveniently. Fan is surprisingly quiet and a nice addition. But since I'm not sure how else the product would prevent a laptop from sliding off an angled base, I find it kinda hard to criticize too harshly for that. Overall, I feel like I made a good choice.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is 7 Star Rating. I love this station. It doesn't fit my backpack properly but I still bring it along with me when working on the go (coffee shops and conferences at hotel lobbies). This station is amazing.","positive":1},{"review":"  This thing has saved my neck and back from constant craning and hunching over to see my laptop screen.

This allows me to stand and work without killing my back, and my back hurts less at work when I really do need to sit...","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall, I am very happy with this product. It is more sturdy than I thought it would be, and makes working on my bed with my laptop much more comfortable. It took me a little while to figure out the setup directions, and sometimes the stand tips over a little if I happen to move. But overall a great product, money was well spent.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like my Pwr+Portable Folding Laptop table. It's nice to not have to keep shifting my laptop on my lap due to the heat it emits. It probably is operator error but I often have difficulties getting each side to match even though it has compass-like dials on each arm so you can match the sides. Regardless, of my complications in getting it set up, I I do love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product. I particularly love that the height can easily be adjusted.  The only thing that I would want to change for me personally is to make it even smaller, since I travel with my entire \"office,\" and I already have a lot to carry.

The combinations it's capable of is pretty impressive. I actually ended up using it for something that didn't occur to me so I will likely buy another one.","positive":1},{"review":"  I recently started working from home, and this stand has been invaluable in helping to keep my old 15\" macbook cool and in a comfortable position for me to use.

Love all the adjustable \"legs\". Even with the angle markers on the adjusting buttons, it can sometimes take a few attempts to get the legs to match.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent table. As with all of those I've tried, it's a bit tricky if you change positions frequently. I'm currently alternating between using it as a stand for my projector (the fan is very helpful for that) and a laptop table.

It is much lighter than the other laptop platforms with fans that I have used. I highly recommend this product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like the versatility of this little desk.

This have been a good investment.","positive":1},{"review":"  stand works well , the only problem I have is with the  surface tilted my laptop slides off.","positive":1},{"review":"  I think I like this. I would prefer the taller version. Anyway is not bad.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've been looking for a portable laptop table because I love using my laptop on my bed.

Keeps it from overheating.","positive":1},{"review":"  The Pwr+Portable has made such a difference in my household.

It's perfect for use on the bed.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it's a little difficult to adjust the legs, and now that t have it set the way I want it I don't want to move them. The fan is great and the table is sturdy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I loved it. It definitely kept my laptop cool while it was running and asleep.

I will update review once I do.","positive":1},{"review":"  I got this for Christmas and have been using it non-stop. I've been dying to be able to lay on the couch and write without having to adjust and balance my laptop.

It super easy to use and definitely gets the job done.","positive":1},{"review":"  Got this to free up some room on my desk since I work from home and I love it. Now I can raise my laptop off the desk, keeping it cool (the fans help as well) and I have room underneath the stand.If there was one thing I would have wanted was for this stand to include additional USB ports and act like a hub, but I'm fine without that. Overall, this is exactly what I wanted and even more flexible than I expected.","positive":1},{"review":"  1. Keeps your laptop cool and well ventilated because your laptop rests on top with the fans running underneath whenlaptop is on.5. Moving around the home office a lot with a laptop, this is a very convenient prop with adjustability to remedy any setupquickly.","positive":1},{"review":"  Overall good. It's light, yet supports laptop all right. I'm not familiar with the internal system of hardware, but the upper part of the laptop gets hot and the fans keep cooling the center.

Love it. I can work on bed now. Thank you.","positive":1},{"review":"  Desk works great.  Very versitile and easy to use.","positive":1},{"review":"  Loved the fan.

This 17 inch pad fits my laptop which is 15. You do have to watch out for long hair getting caught in the fans though as they will stop spinning but its an easy fix just take the 6 screws off the top and you can clean it easily which is another plus. The one thing I do not like which is due to my own fault is if you pick it up wrong and the bar to keep it up right is in the right spot you may pinch yourself.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have had this cooling pad for about a month.  It's probably the best money I have ever spent on a computer accessory. I'd say my laptop stays between 2-5 degrees Celsius cooler with the fan on the stand on.

As others have noted, the flip up legs that keep the MacBook on the cooler are about 3 8 inch too high, so they need to be trimmed, else your wrists will rub them. Usually, higher RPM speed means more noise.  These two fans run relatively slowly compared to some.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use this cooling pad on my lap while watching TV.  It works pretty well for that purpose.  Only time will tell how this product does in that regard.  I would recommend purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought the version that has the hundreds of holes in it.I didn't want those blue lights that come on when plugged in, and while the description did not mention them, it did indeed have the blue lights. The power cord is a little short, but since it's sitting under the power source, it's not a huge deal. I'm using it under my 17\" HP laptop, and there would be very little overhang except one of the tabs to keep the laptop from sliding covers up the hole for the speakers, and I had to shift it over about two inches.","positive":1},{"review":"  Working with the laptop on my lap is fabulous. . Since it's used mostly on my lap, the \"stand\" part is somewhat problematic, but again, I could simply put some tape on it and fix the issue myself. A nice fan that's extending my laptop and my lap.","positive":1},{"review":"  Cooling pad has been working great in the months since I got it. Makes a huge difference in the temperature of the laptop as it rests on my legs.  If I ever need another cooling stand, I'll buy this brand again without hesitation.

Previous cooling fans have had gaps that cause the blankets to get caught in the fans and the plastic was so thin that it broke easily. This is a great laptop cooling desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  Obviously this power pad will tilt for you. This will allow many positions for you to place your laptop, Ipad or whatever you want to place there for your convenience.If you want a Power Pad for your own device, you will not go wrong by purchasing this one.Hands down the best I have found, even when going to other High-End stores, which only mark up the cost for overall profit, andnot care about quality and the end-user.","positive":1},{"review":"  WARNING:  The product has been changed substantially since this review was first posted.I want to give this product more stars, but I've discovered several design issues in the first few minutes of use: - The plastic tabs that hold the computer scrape my wrists.

A more engineering person could probably keep this working for a lot longer (maybe with a metal pin pole, but I'm going to look for a newer product that is similar but hopefully lacks the few drawbacks.","positive":0},{"review":"  I initially really liked it, but have had issues because it is very annoying to adjust. You have to adjust 3 joints on each side and they wont adjust easily if something is already propped on top. Every time I attempt to type at a height that works for me the whole thing tips over. I think if they added a removable counterweight I would be more than happy with the product but as it is i have to use books to prevent it from constantly tipping over.","positive":0},{"review":"  Well. Its a lot less than what I expected but looks like it does the work for what I need...","positive":0},{"review":"  This product is designed quite nice.

Love the fans.  Very good if you use your laptop at all.","positive":1},{"review":"  VERY convenient.  keeps laptop cool and provides platform for working on laptop from my lapUPDATE:  recently I begun to have some problem with the unit -- the fans sometimes stop or won't start at startup.  If I \"jiggle\" the USB power cord a little they will start back (or start up).Not as pleased as I was when I first received it.","positive":0},{"review":"  Noisy, Tabs at bottom to hold laptop in-place poke uncomfortably into bottom of your wrist, and no pass-thru USB plug for power to fan so you don't lose a USB slot on your computer just for power.Good: best fan and air-flow to laptop I've seen, after 3 tried and discarded.","positive":0},{"review":"  So first off, I will say, this product works great.. That being said, I'm going to return the 15\" and get the 17\" version without a second thought in my mind, because it really does do a great job at what it is designed for. They just need to change the description to account for the 2 inch discrepancy.","positive":0},{"review":"  Doesnt cool the laptop at all.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not work.","positive":0},{"review":"  We are happy with the unit but there are several shortcomings that I feel should be addressed. The metal deck the laptop sits on overhangs the base and has a wicked sharp edge. The adjustment for the angle, yeah that needs to lock in some way.

I have used this product for over a month now and it works. the humming sound is more like a low purr. Wonderful product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the first cooling pad I have ever used so I do not know of any other models in the market.I bought this cooling pad a little more than 2 months ago and I'm really happy with the way it's performing. They interfere with my hands when I type on the keyboard. Even then I would definitely recommend this product to my friends for all the other features.","positive":1},{"review":"  A little weak feeling, but holds my 14 inch laptop just fine. Fans work great, however the cord the seller shipped with it was not the right size. Kinda defeats the purpose of ordering one with a usb cord. Then I couldve given it 5 stars, as it is exactly as described.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great fan and lowered the temperature of my Dell Studio by 10 degree C.  Being able to prop the laptop on the cooler pad makes a big difference versus a flat cooling pad.  Most flat pads only made 1 - 2 degrees difference.  I also have multiple HAVIT HV-F2050 which work well, but are not as quiet as the Pwr+ 17 and they cool the same laptop by 6 degrees C.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product. I have a big 17. It's heavy and the front flip up holders are strong and do their job. The company was very helpful and followed up to check on my satisfaction.","positive":1},{"review":"  Fans are quiet and seem slow but it keeps my computer cool even when I am rendering video on adobe premiere. Also, I like the gap created underneath the laptop by the stand as it is a great place to put my cell, burt's bees and other things like pens where they wont roll around and are easy to keep track of.","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this fan to replace another one I had, what I like most is the cord is connected to the back and not a separate USB cord that would keep falling off like my prior one.  This fits my 17\" laptop well and keeps it very cools with two fans while playing FF online and Fallout 4.  I would buy again if I ever need it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This fan was pretty much what I expected going in. It cools my laptop while I'm using it. Overall a good product the only reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are there's no way to turn the light off while it's in use and some of the plastic seems a bit cheap (I've been using it for months and it hasn't seemed like it is in danger of breaking, so the cheap plastic isn't that big of a deal). Also, my laptop is larger than 17\" and the fan still supports it and cools it down just fine, my laptop just hangs over the side a bit.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have a 17\" HP laptop that over heats and this product solves that problem. It sits comfortably on my lap and there is no noticeable noise from the fans. I like that it has little flip up clips that keep the computer from moving forward on the cooling pad.

Cools down a laptop so well I can play at HD for hours.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a great way to keep your laptop cool. It is every bit what is claimed. Just getting up, or picking up the unit with the laptop on it, can get a little \"fumbley\".So glad I bought one.","positive":1},{"review":"  I use it for my 15.6\" Asus but it works exceptionally well. Don't think it's only restricted to 17\" macbooks.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best one I've found, and I've bought several different kinds. Only thing is, you need to clip down the supports as they were too high for my thin Mac powerbook. I also like the multiple levels of tilt available..","positive":1},{"review":"  I bought this to replace another brand's stand that quit working after seven months of use. My MacBook Air runs a lot cooler now, whether in use tucked under the Thunderbolt monitor (that screen puts off a considerable amount of heat) or on my lap..perfect for my needs.","positive":1},{"review":"  Use it every day and it does the trick..the built in fan comes in handy for laptop noise when laptop gets heated up. Service was quick.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everything I was looking for in a cooling stand. My 15\" MacBook Pro fits perfect on the stand. I like how the black handles lift up so it holds my laptop in place, I can adjust the angle and it stays in place, the fan is quiet, and the lots of cool air blows underneath.","positive":1},{"review":"  At first I was concerned this would look a bit geeky, or not exactly follow through on keeping my computer's temp down.  The temp was managed, despite the fact that the  built in fan on my computer and the ventilation were really struggling.  This bad boy kept my computer at around 50 degrees for games like League of Legends.  Awesome product, doesn't look too overboard, and I really like how it elevates my computer and makes it feel like my laptop is more of a desktop when I'm at home.","positive":1},{"review":"  Exactly what was advertised and for a good price. Other reviews complained about the little tabs digging into your wrists when typing, but if this isn't an issue if the platform is inclined, and you can just fold the tabs down when the platform is level.The only things that I would like are a power switch (could be hardware or software) and a way to keep the incline bar from falling when I'm just trying to move the platform.

I would happily recommend tis product to friends.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's great and is functional and the adjustable height has helped me in many cases.

Due to the air circulation, I have found that I do not always need to use the fan, I only plug it in to the USB when needed. Great product.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this product.  It works well and is quiet.  I love that I can adjust the height of it, that is a huge bonus for me.  I plan on replacing it with the same thing when the time comes.","positive":1},{"review":"  The laptop fan has worked flawlessly and has not broken like the other brand I had before.  Cooling surfaces much bigger, hence, feel it is more effective at doing its job.  I am very pleased with the product.","positive":1},{"review":"  A wonderful invention that will let me use my laptop all summer without fear of it or me overheating.  Very convenient to use with the power drawn right from the computer and with adjustable angles.","positive":1},{"review":"  i like it a lot as I can view my laptop without straining my neck looking down all the time.  the only comment would be to have its own power supply instead of using the laptop's battery to power it on and maybe other ports i. usb on the back side.  thank you.","positive":1},{"review":"  After buying many laptop bases, with mixed results, I found this great quality stand.The aluminum top compliments Apple laptops nicely. I have been using mine daily for a couple of months without issues.Recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great - only drawback is the little feet that hold the laptop in place are too high and are uncomfortable - I am going to cut the top 1 4\" or so off of them and then it will be perfect.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works very well at keeping the computer cool and is quiet.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works well, but the two holders to prevent the laptop from sliding off at the bottom stick out into my hands when I type.

It fits my laptop as advertised and does the job well.","positive":1},{"review":"  After trying many different fan coolers for my MacBook Pro, I decided to give this brand a chance.

They love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this PwrPad. It has two fans and fits under my 17\" MAC computer. I use it more on my lap and the arm of my chair. Works great.","positive":1},{"review":"  This works for what I need.  Since I keep it flat all the time, I used a piece of tape to keep the stand in place when I move it around.  It works as expected, and is quiet.  One of the rubber feet came off of the back corner after a couple months, but I should be able to glue it back on.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just bought this cooling pad a few weeks ago.  It seems to work well.  Don't even know it is running.  Good purchase.","positive":1},{"review":"  Use this daily.  Love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Worked better then expected. I have an older Macbook that was beginning to run warm, just resting on the platform is an enormous help sometimes when gaming in starts to warm up, I turn the fans on no issue at all. The upside that I didn't account for is being able to change the angle which while working or gaming is helpful.","positive":1},{"review":"  easy to setup out of box. works great .

My only real 'complaint' or wish is that the USB cord was fully detachable for those times where I don't have it plugged into the laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  I like this product.  It does exactly what it says it will do and keeps my computer cooled.  Mine gets really hot without the fans.

It is more sturdy, made of metal (compared to the plastic build of the Kensington one), has a much more useable design in that you can alter both the height and the angle of the device area. There are four rubber feet on the bottom of the riser protecting your table from scratches, and rubber feet all around the appropriate places whether your device sits flat or tilted.Highly recommended.","positive":1},{"review":"  As far as laptop stands go, this is pretty good. Even though the title of the review puts it in a slightly negative light I still think this is good enough to recommend, as long as the price isn't too high. It is cheap and simply made so you can only go so far with the finesse of the product. As long as you only require a stand for your laptop that will only stay within one room, I can recommend this product to you.","positive":1},{"review":"  We are really pleased with this laptop stand.This allows us to use the laptop screen as a second screen at the same level as our main normal monitor.The feature we like the best is the flexibility to adjust your laptop screen height.Other benefits include heat dissipation from laptop but this hasn`t impacted us before when the laptop has been flat on the desk.","positive":1},{"review":"  A great design which is very strong and sturdy. I have it permanently on my bath seat which I also use as a bath rack, it's wide because it's a seat so I can place this stand on it and watch TV on my tablet whilst having a lovely soak. Even with the case on my tablet this stand gives great support because the arm parts that you place your device on protrude about an inch, which is more than other stands I've tested.I'm very impressed with this stand and recommended it if you're looking for a stand to support a laptop or large tablet.","positive":1},{"review":"  I`ve just started working from home for 4 days a week rather than 1 so purchasing on the edge of the dining table with my laptop is no longer an option.  This laptop stand is just the right height to hold the screen at eye level, while leaving enough space on the desk for a wireless mouse and keyboard.  I had the tray situated too far back at first which made it unstable, but I`ve not got it in the perfect position.  The tray has vents to allow heat to disperse from the bottom of the laptop and it comes with a couple of little tools for adjusting and tightening the joints, but I haven`t needed to use them so far.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best laptop stand I've ever seen, and I've seen a few in my time. Ok, it doesn't accommodate laptops larger than those with a 16\" screen but it has so many other uses that mean that doesn't matter at all. It's got plenty of open areas to keep the air around the item being used cool and prevent overheating. I absolutely love this product and recommend it completely.","positive":1},{"review":"  I really like this z-shaped laptop stand. Aesthetically, it looks great and the choice of material and colour definitely helps. The aluminium stand will define help with heat dissipation.Bringing the laptop screen closer to eye level will also help with corrective posture, too.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the second of 2 laptop risers I have for the two laptops in our household. As they are both white-label products I didn`t think there would be much between them - and I honestly would not have been surprised if they had been totally identical, but actually this one is different.A price of c. \u00a330 is about right for this sort of thing, but just make sure you get a non-wobbly model or look for one that might have a slightly thicker larger base.","positive":0},{"review":"  I've tried a fair few of these laptop stands risers over the years, and most are pretty bad, I've found. But not this one, not at all. It's incredibly flexible and adjustable, so you can set it to whatever height and angle suits you. Overall, very impressed with this piece, and definitely recommend.","positive":1},{"review":"  So I got this to be used on a multipurpose desk.I liked the fact you can adjust it to what angle and height you want.

Please let me know if you did.","positive":1},{"review":"  I was really pleased with this laptop stand when I opened it, it is quite stiff to open which makes it really sturdy, a tool is included so you can tighten it if it does loosen up.I tried my 13 inch and 16 inch laptop and it holds them both perfectly with no problems and no chance of it moving.This is made out of aluminium and folds down quite flat making it easy to store when not in use, I really love how you can adjust it to make the screen the angle you want it.Overall this is a fantastic sturdy laptop stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a high quality product from its packaging right down to the brushed aluminium stand.  It's robust, strong and adjustable on hight and angle.  However, I fully recommend it.  It has the look and ergonomic feel of an Apple product.","positive":1},{"review":"  The TECOOL adjustable laptop stand has an aluminum construction and compliments well with Apple Macbook Pro.

It is firm enough to adjust positions without having a loose feel to it. If it does come loose this does come with a tool to tighten it up however I have messed about with it loads and its still as sturdy as it was when we first got it.I would trust my expensive items on this stand as it is a very good product that fits laptops or tablets that are 9-16 inches in size.","positive":1},{"review":"  This review concerns the TECOOL Laptop Stand Notebook Holder, Adjustable Aluminum Multi-Angle Computer Elevator Riser Heat-Vent Cooling Stand for Macbook Pro, Air, Dell, HP, All 9.7\"-15.A versatile, multi- position holder manufactured to high standards from aluminium alloy. Easily positioned into your ideal viewing angle - and it stays there whilst still offering extra viewing options if required.","positive":1},{"review":"  I found this product to be very useful for me as my living room table is quite low and it is where I spend most of my time. I have back pain issues and after hours in from of the laptop and bending towards it can become a problem. At first, I was a bit sceptical when I saw it is made from aluminium, but actually, it is very sturdy, has good ventilation and adjustable height. Very happy with the product.","positive":1},{"review":"  This arrives packed flat but has instructions on the package on how to open and extend it. This photo shows my laptop which is 14 and it fits nicely.  The angle can be adjusted to suit the user and makes it easier to use. The Stand also takes my 9 ipad and I think I am going to find this very useful indeed.","positive":1},{"review":"  A very sturdy metal construction. My 13 Mac book sits on it perfectly. Very good if working from home and needing to use laptops.

It was horrible.","positive":0},{"review":"  I first approached this skeptically because this laptop is marketed under a brand that is not a common name in the United States and is priced very well for its specifications. I will say so far I am pleasantly surprised. Keyboard feels nice.

Amazon should be ashamed to make this a Prime eligible product.","positive":0},{"review":"  This has been a disaster. It comes with a trial version of Windows 10 Home, which means that you will be buying a Windows license for it separately after you get it.

Handhabung ist kinderleicht. Mit mehreren Ger\u00e4ten getestet, alle waren super geeignet.","positive":1},{"review":"  Usually I find laptop stands to be less than useful - for laptops - but the right ones are great for desktop synths. This TECOOL aluminium one is good for heavier, flat form factor synthesisers such as the Novation Peak, tilting the control panel forward without taking up more space and folding almost completely flat when being moved. It's simple, but well put together and finished. Definitely worth the couple of pounds extra over a plastic, bulky one - though if you like to stand your laptop upright, you'll want to keep looking.","positive":1},{"review":"  I've only been using this a few hours and already I'm wondering why I didn't get one sooner. Having compared it to other laptop risers stands on the market, it is somewhat limited in how high it can raise the whole screen, say for someone who is intending on using it with a separate keyboard attached. I've tried to illustrate the highest, lowest from one side of the stand, and a couple of settings that work for me in the photographs, however how each level adjusts the screen angle (and whether that works for you) is very much going to depend on how you have the rest of your work area set up, and how much the screen itself will adjust. It's very much a case of playing around with it and finding what works personally.","positive":1},{"review":"  Laptops are great, but they do have a few issues.  Firstly the angle is not exactly ideal for typing as ideally you have a slightly angled keyboard, secondly due to the compact design and constant efforts made to make laptops thinner and more compact they can suffer from overheating.  This stand allows me to angle the panel such that completing the painting is much easier than using the panel laid flat.  So a very versatile, well made accessory.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have an old-ish laptop with a 15.6\" screen and it's a little heavier than the current brand new ones(even has a optical drive, which seem to be rarer than hens' teeth these days. I also like how neatly this folds up into a flat item which takes up less room than a square thin book.Only a few things would need to be changed to be absolutely perfect, but I'm happy to give this 5 stars, taking into account my personal set up.","positive":1},{"review":"  I have looked at using this type of stand for a while and wondered if it really helped using a laptop. The answer after trying this one is that it does make typing easier and lifts the screen to a good height.If my review helps your buying decision please click the 'helpful' button so I know I am not wasting my time. Thanks.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is much more stable than my usual laptop stand which is a leg on each side type. Having the single plate with just the one angle to arrange, that if the height is far quicker to set up as well. My one minor grip is I might have liked the base to be higher so that the height of the webcam more closely matched my desk situation. But that is a minor gripe considering all the benefits this stand literally brings to the table.","positive":1},{"review":"  As more of us work from home, we are using laptops. But the problem is that these sit lower on a desk or table, so you are peering down, raising the risk of back issues. The stand is adjustable, which is handy, as you may want it flatter if typing, but higher if mostly listening and contributing to a virtual meeting, as this enables a better view.  I really like this, and its now a permanent feature with my laptop.","positive":1},{"review":"  The quality of this stand is really good, really well made, very sturdy but lightweight, you can adjust the height and angle that suits you, not only will it improve the way you use your laptop and reduce negative side effects such as chronic back and neck strain. This\u00a0 let your machine breathe more easily and keep your laptop cool. This is travel friendly and will fit in any standard Laptop bag, but\u00a0 for me this is better for home or office used\u00a0 because this is more\u00a0 bigger and sturdier than other laptop stands. I have this in colour grey and love it.","positive":1},{"review":"  A little expensive for my liking, but it feels well made and sturdy.  It is non-slip and reversible.  When putting a full-sized laptop on it, even on the lowest 'tier' the laptop is precariously placed and has a tendency to fall back, potentially damaging it.  To remedy this flaw, the part that holds the laptop needs to be considerably longer.","positive":0},{"review":"  We're all working from home now and so items like this are handy for sorting one of the problems that comes from working on a laptop with a monitor below the correct eye level. But even on its lowest setting I found that this clever and well made stand was placing my keyboard at an angle that made typing uncomfortable. So I will use it for when I'm doing less intensive writing or watching video content.","positive":0},{"review":"  This is simply fantastic and a real sturdy holder.Used for one our our smallest laptops (14\"), it's often difficult to find a decent and quality holder for smaller models.Best of all, this holder makes it more comfortable to use a laptop for longer periods.With practical heat dissipation, this really is a 5 star model and is recommended if you find yourself using your laptop, or tablet, on a regular basis.","positive":1},{"review":"  Since March i have been working from home - 7 hours a day sat at a laptop either typing or holing online meetings - after a few weeks i was getting cramps and aches in my hands. forearms and shoulders - i spoke to my emplyer who sent me out a similar model to this but it was raised on a platform, it was just as uncomfortable to use and not that sturdy.","positive":1},{"review":"  I currently use a plastic Ikea laptop stand but it`s static so there no height movement and no real room for the air vents to have enough air circulating to stop the laptop from over heating. This is perfect because there`s alternative height levels, and there`s plenty of gaps so the laptop doesn`t overheat. It folds flat too so sits easily in a drawer, or a laptop bag as it`s not that heavy either.  Tablets fit nicely on it too, so it`s an all round great stand.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is a very simple idea to raise up the screen of the laptop, making the camera a bit more flattering, and giving a good angle to type on (at the lower setting - otherwise I fear a bit of carpal tunnel).Super easy to set up and well constructed from aluminium so super strong.  Possibly helps with air flow too.An excellent accessory.","positive":1},{"review":"  If you work on the road, or at client sites, you'll appreciate the fold flat nature of this laptop stand. It gives you a wide range of adjustment in terms of laptop angle. It is well made from a sheet of aluminium. My one criticism would be that its slightly heavier than you'd expect.","positive":1},{"review":"  Compact stand, easy to store as it all collapses and easy to set up. Great that the angle is adjustable and that there is rubber sponge in place to support the laptop from sliding getting scratched. As it is made of metal it isn`t the lightest but still easy enough to transport or carry in your laptop bag.","positive":1},{"review":"  This comes at a premium price, but it is aluminum alloy so very strong and light.  The design is good too.  It really helps to disapate heat and the range of display angles is perfect \ud83d\ude42Overall this is a good solution and should give years of service.  Expensive but probably worth it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great product, really lightweight, very comfortable, has 5 angles, so helps with long hours sitting next to the laptop, also great for improve your sitting so you arent so tired. Also its very compact, as you can fold it down and it doesnt take much space.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s a nice solid chunk of metal that folds away flat.

It neatens up the desk, allows easy access to the three USB ports located on the bottom of one support leg and puts the iMac at just the right hight when I place it on the glass.  There is a weight limit on what you place on the glass top but even though I didn't weigh the screen the glass is tempered and the legs seem to be holding up without any problem.  I would definitely recommend this item.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good item. I just wish it wasn't expensive. The cup holder can fit short, small coffee mugs, but I wouldn't recommend putting anything large or heavy in it. I've spilled a tall, glass cup of water when trying to use it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Buy as many as you need. it's lightweight, attractive, minimalist, and adds USB ports to your desktop. This holds my 24\" monitor,  which has an oval shaped 8\" x 9 1 2\" base, and my full size HP laptop is underneath.  You can spend less, and maybe when others see this it'll become a more popular style, but for now this stand is a standout.","positive":1},{"review":"  For what I need it for which is putting my books on it so I can do HW in front of my computer it's great.

It supports it just fine, size is perfect and it raised it just enough to be eye level. I haven't used the USB feature on it, but I do use the holder for my phone - keeps it handy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great sleek design. I use this everyday for work. The phone holder is perfect. I haven't found much use for the cup holder because I usually drink out of ware bottles but the 3 extra ports have been very useful.","positive":1},{"review":"  This has been holding up my 20\" monitor for eons now, no bowing. I don't trust the cup holder though. And if my phone is standing up (the HTC M7), it's bound to fall out of the phone holder. I just put photos in it, and put a pen cup in the cup holder.","positive":1},{"review":"  Received mine and was ablw to assemble within eight minutes of opening the box.

Very happy.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great aesthetic and holds well.","positive":1},{"review":"  This tempered glass platform is perfect for using a graphics tablet.  The keyboard is still accessible underneath and the active drawing surface is directly below the screen.

Maybe that's more the cable, but I can get the same cable to work with other USB ports.","positive":1},{"review":"  This product is really good for its price.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sturdy.

Two suggestions please:*Make additional cup phone holders available.*Offer either taller supports or have spacers or what not to raise the shelf.","positive":1},{"review":"  Great addition to any desk - looks and works great. Bear in mind that the ports are USB 2. Would have been great if they offered those only as add-on purchases. Another downside is that the plastic stands feel a bit cheap, and scratches quite easily.","positive":1},{"review":"  very nice for your computer and look nice.","positive":1},{"review":"  LOVE IT.","positive":1},{"review":"  Get many compliments at work. Looks very nice.

I'm happy to say that this product fit the bill. I don't use the phone or the drink holder accessories because they don't seem very stable, but the stand itself is great.

The four usb ports all work and are a bonus5. And yes, I would HIGHLY recommend it.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is exactly what I expected it to be. I needed a way to raise my monitor and be able to hide my keyboard to make space on my desk. The USB hub part is a nice extra. The cup and phone holders should not be trusted.","positive":1},{"review":"  What more can I add that the title doesn't already say, this stand works perfect for my needs and supports myHP 24\" monitor perfectly.","positive":1},{"review":"  Keeps my desk organized. Good quality glass and the USB ports are very convenient. Just what i was looking for.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great for my 30 inch monitor.","positive":1},{"review":"  New laptop fits underneath with monitor on top and wireless keyboard and mouse.  The cup holder only works with the espresso cups we use.  The phone stand works well with a Nexus 4, even though it was designed for an iphone.","positive":1},{"review":"  easy to assemble, solid, rubber feet (and the monitor's weight) keep it from sliding on your desktop. The USB ports are a nice touch. I would have added two more attachment points for the holders, allowing more flexibility in mounting. As it is, they are either both in front or both in back.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just got this last night and set it up.  I need to stack 2 keyboards for my personal work machines and this makes it easy.

A week later I received an email from SA Technology with a profuse apology and an offer of a newer version of the product with free return of the old UBoard. This company obviously cares about happy, satified customers. Just for customer service alone they deserve 5 STARS.","positive":1},{"review":"  I received this for a Mother's Day gift and I love it. Don't really have room for the cup holder or phone holder. It's tall enough to store items under it and short enough that whatever I place on the shelf (iPhone, stapler, post-it & tape dispenser, etc.) don't block my screen.","positive":1},{"review":"  This item is handy and looks quite smart. It was a gift for my husband who was working temporarily in a very small space. The only possible criticism is the cup-holder.

She loves combing her hair and she can brush as much as she wants, without her wig coming off.","positive":1},{"review":"  I liked it for an everyday wear. But if your sweating or have oily skin it may not be the best for long time wear. It was a little shiny through the lace but nothing a little powder couldn`t fix. My one complaint was getting off of my wig was a serious process.","positive":1},{"review":"  This tape really works. Just be careful with how close you put it to your hairline because it will take some of your hair. Also, I have had slight issues with the tape not properly adhering to my wig once I sweat but that might be due to the concealer that I use on my lace. Other than that, it works so well.","positive":1},{"review":"  So this tape definitely holds when used properly.  Tips: use tweezers to apply and adhere, when wet let it dry completely and it will hold again,  holds with sweating.I have had my wig on for over a week, I have worked out, showered, its still sticking.","positive":1},{"review":"  Needed extra hold because my wig kept riding up the nape of my head, these tapes work GREAT. Great holding ability. Highly recommend this product..","positive":1},{"review":"  This is an amazing product. I love using these so far because they really hold well. I`ve had these 3 strips in place for 7`days now and they are just starting to come up. These  hold better than others I`ve tried in the past.","positive":1},{"review":"  Exactly as pictured. I got about 40 strips that you can break into two if needed so I guess 80 squares. I bought this for a lace front wig and it is stuck on my head honey, it`s not moving at all. Will update once I wear it out and about all day at work.","positive":1},{"review":"  It was my first time using tape, and I dont think I would ever use it again.","positive":0},{"review":"  Don`t stick for to long..","positive":0},{"review":"  The tape lasts only about 9 days, while it starts leaking in about a week. It's hard to get rid of. After removing the strips, the glue covers the base everywhere. One of the lowest quality tapes I've ever used.","positive":0},{"review":"  They do not stick for very long it's poor adhesive there should be a better quality of adhesive on them to secure your wig, very disappointed.","positive":0},{"review":"  Very bad quality, This product came in poor condition, it is sticky almost impossible to separate one from the other, it is in very bad condition, I have lost my money.","positive":0},{"review":"  All pieces are not created equal and does not adhere as described. Price too high for the quality. get the same strips for cheaper from your local hair store.","positive":0},{"review":"  Ripped the baby hairs out of my head. Stuck so tight..","positive":0},{"review":"  They don`t work..","positive":0},{"review":"  I like nothing about this pack, I`ve purchased multiple packs of tape from this company.","positive":0},{"review":"  I did not like these.","positive":0},{"review":"  I love these. So easy to tape down a lace front. I'm not sure how well it would hold up for longer use, I only use them for a few hours. Easy to remove with alcohol.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very surprised,  in a good way,  how well the tape holds my lace closure.  I finally found a product that gives me a natural look without applying glue or some other chemical to my wigs.Easy cleaning.","positive":1},{"review":"  Just as described. Shipped very fast.","positive":1},{"review":"  Okay so this wig tape is better than I expected. It`s very strong and lasted over a week it could have lasted longer but I just wanted to switch wig. I will tell you this is comparable to bold hold wig tape and cost less. I removed it easy with wig removal spray.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pretty.","positive":1},{"review":"  I'm so in love with this because it's like when you sweat the strips the adhesive on them kick in and it's like it's super hold your unit down.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is the best tape I`ve ever came across. You really have to pry it off your head. If you need double sided tape for clothes this is it too. I used it for a bathing suit and went swimming and played volleyball in the pool and the girls stayed secure the whole time.","positive":1},{"review":"  I love this wig tape, I wear wigs a lot for a protective style and I would say that I love these.. The wind was blowing today and my wig was not going anywhere. I definitely recommended  these more than the got2be glue gel.","positive":1},{"review":"  It sticks really well.","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great. Keeps my wig on forever. Actually have to rub with oil to remove. No complaints.","positive":1},{"review":"  Ripped my hair out...","positive":0},{"review":"  Dont work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I gave the easiness to remove 5 stars because it doesn`t stay down. This tape is trash.","positive":0},{"review":"  Does not work.","positive":0},{"review":"  I'm sorry didn't work for me.","positive":0},{"review":"  Package came in good. The tape worked well with my wig.","positive":0},{"review":"  Did not work for me. Very disappointed in this item.","positive":0},{"review":"  I can't actually get them to stick to my skin, so I can't write a proper review. But the fact they didn't stick in the first place was a real bummer. But if you're purchasing these strips to REMEDY a wig sliding off a sweaty head, you'll probably want to look elsewhere. I gave 2 stars because, again, these might be great for someone else with fewer needs than I have in the wig adhesive department.","positive":0},{"review":"  By far one of the worst products I`ve bought a majority of the tape was stuck to the paper and would not even come apart it was basically a huge waste of money.","positive":0},{"review":"  Face irritated by tape.I don't trust the tape's quality.","positive":0},{"review":"  Holds your wig down securely.","positive":1},{"review":"  I am very highly happy with the product that I bought because I used to use others stickers for my  Wigs to stay on I have alopecia this one sticks to me like glue I am a happy camper and I know other people I have told so they can buy it to thank you Amazon.","positive":1},{"review":"  Excellent with hold last 4 weeks super strong only thing I use.","positive":1},{"review":"  These provide great hold. Easy to remove from your skin with a little hair oil or vaseline.","positive":1},{"review":"  Very large, but easy to trim and customize for wig. Held amazing everywhere except for back of neck, but that could have been user error. I have yet to try it again.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s not so easy to remove but it does it`s job I liked it.","positive":1},{"review":"  So, I was worried about these being able to keep my wig secure, but they work great. I put one at the top of my head and one at the base of my neck over my skull cap. It was recommended by a friend to use it on my skin hair instead of the skull cap but it worked great. I love these things.","positive":1},{"review":"  This is definitely THE STRONGEST TAPE I`ve ever used....","positive":1},{"review":"  It just worked really well for me and my wigs. I have not tried it out in water. I would write it at 5 but I don't know how it does in water that's the only reason I have not ready to do the five. It arrived very quickly but did not come with instructions.","positive":1},{"review":"  Holds very good.","positive":1},{"review":"  The BEST..ITS been 10days and hella strong..","positive":1},{"review":"  Works great and supper sticky. If u don't know how to use these watch a video first so u don't pull out ur hair.","positive":1},{"review":"  It's served its purpose securing my lace front wigs.","positive":1},{"review":"  Really good holdUse alcohol n u will be goodWay better n less messy than the glue.","positive":1},{"review":"  Loved it.","positive":1},{"review":"  Will definitely order again work`s really well as a breast tape as well as wig tap.","positive":1},{"review":"  Good adhesions.","positive":1},{"review":"  Its great i just havent gotten the hang of it should invlude some recommendations on how to use great customer service.","positive":1},{"review":"  It`s work good.","positive":1},{"review":"  Pretty strong I even slept with my wig and it still didn`t budge will be buying again.","positive":1},{"review":"  Everthing described in the description.","positive":1},{"review":"  Sticks very well.
